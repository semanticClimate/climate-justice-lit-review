Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education encourages that the connection between science and society be explicitly taught in science classrooms. Here, I describe a fictional case study where students decide how to allocate a budget at a non-profit organization tasked with mitigating environmental issues in a town that contains environmental justice communities. Students are each assigned a role in the community and must reach a consensus on their budget in small groups before the whole class votes on a consensus budget. Afterward, students perform a metacognitive activity that encourages them to reflect on the human health impacts of their decisions and how their role impacted their decision-making process. Quantitative and qualitative feedback from students shows that by the end of the course, students appreciate the importance of science literacy in understanding global issues and that they are able to connect environmental justice to their lives and coursework. This case study helps fill an unmet need in climate change education by allowing students to practice empathy in topics related to climate change and environmental justice.", "affiliation": "Curriculum Fellows Program, Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print-Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Climate change", "Case Study", "Environmental Justice", "Metacognition", "Environmental Racism", "Roleplaying"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1128/jmbe.00005-24"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC11044616"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC11044616?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "N", "license": "cc by-nc-nd", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2024-04-25", "firstIndexDate": "2024-04-26", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2024-04-29", "dateOfRevision": "2024-04-27", "electronicPublicationDate": "2024-03-05", "firstPublicationDate": "2024-03-05"}
