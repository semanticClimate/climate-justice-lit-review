Politics notwithstanding, medical school curricula that are current and structured to train the next generation of physicians to adhere to our profession's highest values of fairness, humanity, and scientific excellence are of utmost importance to health care quality and innovation worldwide. Whereas the number of anti-racism, diversity, equity, and inclusion (ARDEI) curricular innovations have increased, there is a dearth of published longitudinal health equity curriculum models. In this article, we describe our school's curricular mapping process toward the longitudinal integration of ARDEI learning objectives across 4 years and ultimately creation of an ARDEI medical education program objective (MEPO) domain.<h4>Methods</h4>Medical students and curricular faculty leaders developed 10 anti-racism learning objectives to create an ARDEI MEPO domain encompassing three ARDEI learning objectives.<h4>Results</h4>A pilot survey indicates that medical students who have experienced this curriculum are aware of the longitudinal nature of the ARDEI curriculum and endorse its effectiveness.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A longitudinal health equity and justice curriculum with well-defined anti-racist objectives that is (a) based within a supportive learning environment, (b) bolstered by trusted, structured avenues for student feedback and (c) amended with iterative revisions is a promising model to ensure that medical students are equipped to effectively address health inequities and deliver the highest quality of care for all patients.", "affiliation": "Department of Population and Family Health, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, 722 W 168th St, New York, NY, 10032, USA.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Humans"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Longitudinal Studies"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Cultural Diversity"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Social Justice"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Curriculum"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Education, Medical"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Education, Medical, Undergraduate"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Students, Medical"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "United States"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Racism", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "PC", "qualifierName": "prevention & control", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Health Equity"}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Curriculum", "Undergraduate Medical Education", "Curricular Mapping", "Health Equity", "Anti-racism"]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-024-06235-y"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC11520576"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC11520576?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "Y", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "Y", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "Y", "license": "cc by-nc-nd", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2024-10-30", "dateOfCreation": "2024-10-30", "firstIndexDate": "2024-10-30", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2024-11-06", "dateOfRevision": "2024-11-01", "electronicPublicationDate": "2024-10-29", "firstPublicationDate": "2024-10-29"}
