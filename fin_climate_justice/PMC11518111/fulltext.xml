Essential areas of focus have therefore been stakeholder-specific communication and establishing a network of experts for continued scientific exchange.</p></sec><sec id="s4859"><title>Results</title><p>The publication of the report as peer-reviewed articles has served to reach the scientific community. Another target group are public health practitioners and decision makers at subnational levels, who can contribute towards climate change mitigation and adaptation measures relevant to health, as recommended in the report. This latter group was reached through various methods and formats of science communication, including conferences aimed at the public health sector, through target-group oriented podcasts, social media engagement and digital town hall discussions. Following publication, the experts involved in writing, reviewing and using the report were invited to establish a network in order to support long-term scientific exchange and collaborations and in turn ensure the report&#x02019;s sustainable impact and value.</p></sec><sec id="s4860"><title>Lessons</title><p>Through follow-up evaluations, the reception of the report and the further communication needs of this target group were analysed. A major lesson was to include the insights of public health practitioners more systematically and at an earlier stage in any future reports. As for the establishment of a network, a survey amongst the authors and other experts showed what this group considers the goals of this network: creating synergies and connections with existing initiatives and providing a platform for further exchange, especially amongst researchers addressing similar questions, such as the efficacy of mitigation and adaptation measures, from different angles.</p></sec><sec id="s4861"><title>Key messages</title><p>&#x02022;&#x02002;Local public health practitioners are important stakeholders for climate change and health for ensuring public health impact.</p><p>&#x02022;&#x02002;The expertise in the network will support continued scientific exchange on climate change and health and thus ensure the national report&#x02019;s sustainability.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
