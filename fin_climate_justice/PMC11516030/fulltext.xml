It is an update of a similar report from 2010 and includes review articles and syntheses on the effects of climate change on human health through various influences such as heat, extreme weather, UV radiation, air pollutants and allergens, as well as the effect of climate change on infectious diseases through vector-borne, water-borne or food-borne pathogens. Literature reviews on the potential impact on antimicrobial resistance and mental health explore less well researched effects of climate change on health. The report discusses climate change communication and climate justice as cross-cutting issues and closes with an analysis of the options for action recommended throughout the preceding chapters. While the coordination of this report was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Health, the content was compiled by an advisory board of scientists and the authors recruited by them. The status report is published as 14 individual scientific papers in three issues of the peer-reviewed Journal of Health Monitoring and is available open access in English and in German in order to reach a large scientific audience. Besides the scientific audience, another target group are local authorities contributing towards adaptation and mitigation measures. Insights from the report are being communicated by diverse channels specifically to this latter group and are taken into consideration in the process of shaping the German Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
