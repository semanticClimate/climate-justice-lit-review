We argue that Earth&#x02019;s rights encompass and include the right to health and can be integrated into international human rights frameworks to protect all forms of life, responding to colonial legacies of discrimination and violence. We respond to the scarcity of literature discussing Earth&#x02019;s rights in relation to situations where human rights and Earth&#x02019;s rights are violated. We ground our argument in the theoretical conceptualization of Latin American proposals of Earth&#x02019;s rights and its potential for actionable policy approaches that include human health as inevitably interconnected to our planet&#x02019;s well-being. We address the environmental injustices that affect the right to health and argue that an Earth&#x02019;s rights framework can support reparations for historically marginalized communities.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Earth rights</kwd><kwd>human rights</kwd><kwd>health</kwd><kwd>indigenous communities</kwd><kwd>climate migration</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>typesetter</meta-name><meta-value>ts1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Climate change has caused substantial population migration and will continue to do so (<xref rid="bibr14-10901981241232642" ref-type="bibr">EcoWatch, 2020</xref>).

We argue that Earth&#x02019;s Rights, also known as &#x0201c;rights of nature,&#x0201d; contribute to a global governance agenda that supports health equity and the advancement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for these populations (<xref rid="bibr44-10901981241232642" ref-type="bibr">United Nations, 2023</xref>).

Earth&#x02019;s Rights as presented by Bolivia in the World People&#x02019;s Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth and defended principally by indigenous peoples and environmental leaders in the Latin American region proposes a lens on justice and health that can inform the global governance agenda through concrete legal actions and reparations (<xref rid="bibr38-10901981241232642" ref-type="bibr">Tanyag, 2020</xref>).</p><p>The Universal Declaration of the Rights of Mother Earth asserts that Earth&#x02019;s Rights are considered indivisible from any other living being&#x02019;s rights to life, well-being, and health.

The term &#x0201c;being,&#x0201d; in this case, refers to ecosystems, natural communities, species, and all other natural entities that exist as part of the Earth. The Rights of Nature are grounded in the recognition that humankind and Nature have a fundamental and non-anthropocentric relationship, and there is a need for actions that respect this relationship (<xref rid="bibr43-10901981241232642" ref-type="bibr">United Nations, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Within Earth&#x02019;s rights, the Declaration includes the right to life and to exist, to be respected, to regenerate, to maintain its identity and integrity as a distinct, self-regulating, and interrelated being, and to have water, clean air, and other sustenance essential for life (<xref rid="bibr28-10901981241232642" ref-type="bibr">Plurinational State of Bolivia &#x00026; General Evaluation of Climate Change Negotiations, 2011</xref>). The Declaration also includes a set of obligations of human beings toward the Earth. Although this has yet to become a legally binding, it sets the basis for important conceptualizations of the Rights of Nature, human obligations to protect it, and the implementation of actions that shift the balance toward a more inclusive environmental justice paradigm beyond the colonial legacies imprinted in the region (<xref rid="bibr28-10901981241232642" ref-type="bibr">Plurinational State of Bolivia &#x00026; General Evaluation of Climate Change Negotiations, 2011</xref>).

Climate change affects population health via two pathways: (1) directly through extreme weather events (extreme heat, floods, or natural disasters) and social consequences of climate change (displacement, forced migration) and (2) indirectly related to malnutrition and food insecurity, infectious diseases, impacts to mental health, water availability, and social violence (<xref rid="bibr22-10901981241232642" ref-type="bibr">Levy &#x00026; Patz, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr29-10901981241232642" ref-type="bibr">Pradyumna, 2018</xref>).

Central and South American farmers, peasants, indigenous, and Afro communities who are highly dependent on agriculture are affected by industrialized countries&#x02019; economic expansion, land grabbing, air and water pollution, toxicant release, over-fishing, expansion of extensive livestock, mono-cropping, and other extractive activities directly impacting ecosystems, making way for violence and population displacement (<xref rid="bibr17-10901981241232642" ref-type="bibr">Global Witness, 2019</xref>).

When extreme weather events such as droughts, hurricanes, floods, or heat waves leave communities unprotected and unable to fend for themselves and their families, agriculture-dependent populations are forced to flee, becoming climate-affected communities, climate migrants, and/or refugees impacted through the second pathway (indirectly through climate change&#x02019;s impacts on population health).</p><p>By 2050, the number of climate-related migrants and refugees is estimated to reach 1 billion worldwide due to shoreline erosion, coastal flooding, and agricultural disruption (<xref rid="bibr14-10901981241232642" ref-type="bibr">EcoWatch, 2020</xref>).

This conceptualization presents all forms of life intertwined, a postcolonial understanding of rights and health.</p><p>The Regional Agreement on Access to Information, Public Participation, and Justice in Environmental Matters in Latin America and the Caribbean, also known as the Escaz&#x000fa; Agreement, is a critical step toward the implementation of actionable policies and programs to protect Earth&#x02019;s rights. Escaz&#x000fa; is a legally binding agreement that entered into force in April 2021 and aims to guarantee information, participation, and justice regarding environmental issues. It especially considers the impacts of environmental degradation on minoritized people, indigenous communities, and defenders of the environment (<xref rid="bibr42-10901981241232642" ref-type="bibr">United Nations, 2018</xref>). One of the innovative features of the Escaz&#x000fa; Agreement is the right to a healthy environment and sustainable development on an international level, and the protection of all environmental defenders including individuals, groups, and organizations.

These sanctions ought not only to be punitive but should be focused on a reparations system where ecosystems, communities, and individuals can be compensated for received harms and their relationship to the land is included. Such a system should not depend on the political and/or economic interests of countries present in the United Nations.

Environmental justice has been traditionally defined from a distributional perspective as the &#x0201c;equal distribution of environmental goods and negatives&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bibr31-10901981241232642" ref-type="bibr">Schlosberg &#x00026; Carruthers, 2010</xref>, p. 13).

These pillars are (1) procedural: participation of communities affected by specific environmental issues in key decision-making; (2) recognition of historically marginalized communities; (3) productive or ecological justice for non-anthropocentric beings; and (4) restorative justice: reparation of communities or people affected by environmental issues or crimes (<xref rid="bibr26-10901981241232642" ref-type="bibr">Pedersen, 2010</xref>).

We propose to consider these principles within the Earth&#x02019;s Rights perspective and Planetary health agendas to establish clear pathways of protecting the communities (including indigenous communities), the environment, and the relationships with and life of non-human entities (see <xref rid="fig1-10901981241232642" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="section4-10901981241232642"><title>Recommendations and Conclusions</title><p>We propose the inclusion of Earth&#x02019;s rights in formal international treaties and humanitarian law to better address environmental degradation, forced-climate migration, and Earth&#x02019;s rights violations. There is a current need to establish Earth&#x02019;s rights in international binding treaties like the Escaz&#x000fa; agreement that can help build and enforce international mechanisms to hold states and private actors accountable in high-, middle-, and low-income countries for damages to the Earth. To monitor and sanction actions against the environment, the health of populations disproportionately affected by pollution and climate change in middle- and low-income countries, as well as violence against indigenous communities and environmental defenders, high-income countries should engage actively with policy and programmatic actions enforcing environmental justice views and pillars. A rights-based approach to protecting, respecting, and fulfilling Earth&#x02019;s rights also contributes to the advancement of human rights protections for disenfranchised, historically minoritized communities, partly repairing colonial legacies of ethnic/race-based discrimination and violence including that inflicted to climate migrants.</p><p>A global governance agenda could further facilitate the regulation of extractive economies by installing reparations and accountability systems for low- and middle-income countries that bear the burden of environmental degradation and health impacts on their populations. Reparations in this context include the recognition and exposure of countries and corporations most responsible for the climate crisis of the harms caused. This includes harms inflicted upon previous generations by colonial structures and relationships of power, from which contemporary generations are benefiting from (<xref rid="bibr33-10901981241232642" ref-type="bibr">Shue, 1999</xref>). Reparations also entail raising funds and gathering resources from the principal countries and corporations responsible for the climate crisis. These should be distributed to finance adaptation programs and building resilience in low-income countries most affected by the climate crisis (<xref rid="bibr7-10901981241232642" ref-type="bibr">Chapman &#x00026; Ahmed, 2021</xref>).

In addition, the adoption of fair climate migration policies that include climate migration as a direct consequence of the impact of high-income countries extractive economies ought to be included in international human rights law.</p><p>The post-World War II definitions of migration and refugee status need to be updated. We call for a revision of the term &#x0201c;refugee&#x0201d; as it is currently presented in international humanitarian law to include climate migrants, so that more protections can be implemented with an Earth&#x02019;s rights approach. Special attention should also be paid to environmental leaders&#x02019; killings, threats, torture, and forced displacement in Latin America, as well as to detrimental activities against Earth&#x02019;s rights. Research agendas targeting these actions and knowledge gaps should also include neglected environmental violence in the region and its causes. From an Earth right&#x02019;s governance agenda, this means not only the adoption of measures to mitigate and dismantle colonial legacies and structures, but also the recognition of other ways to relate to the Earth, to other non-human beings, and to decisions regarding the environment in political, social, and community decision-making. Thus, research and actions should focus on collaborations with indigenous-driven organizations and the co-development of knowledge production.</p><p>Finally, we suggest that the international community consider separations for harms done to the Earth and to ecosystems. Reparations could be made by enforcing more equitable land distribution, participatory governance, and disseminating scientific approaches that support local environmental protections. Exemplary sanctions and political control of participation in the United Nations system should also be considered.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to acknowledge all environmental defenders and leaders in the Global South who stand against violence and injustice, committing their lives to the defense of the Earth.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>ORCID iD:</bold> Catalina Correa-Salazar <inline-graphic xlink:href="10.1177_10901981241232642-img1.jpg"/>
