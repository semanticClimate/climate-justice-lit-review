However, there needs to be more investigation into the complex relationship between teaching-research conflict and turnover intentions from the perspective of this theory. To address these gaps, this study, grounded in the JD-R theory, explores the relationships among teaching-research conflict, career adaptability, justice climate, job burnout, and turnover intention.<h4>Methods</h4>Data collected through an online survey involving 858 Chinese university teachers, and the analysis utilized a Multilevel Structural Equation Model (MSEM) with Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation.<h4>Results</h4>The findings reveal that job burnout mediates the relationship between teaching-research conflict and turnover intention. Career adaptability plays a moderating role in the connection between job burnout and turnover intention. Furthermore, justice climate exhibits a cross-level interaction effect concerning the relationship between teaching-research conflict and turnover intention.<h4>Discussion</h4>These findings offer innovative strategies for mitigating and preventing faculty turnover intention.", "affiliation": "School of Education, Guangzhou University, Guangzhou, China.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic-eCollection", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Job Burnout", "Turnover Intention", "Justice Climate", "Career Adaptability", "Teaching-Research Conflict"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1283477"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC10716314"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC10716314?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "N", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2023-12-14", "firstIndexDate": "2023-12-22", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2023-12-15", "dateOfRevision": "2023-12-14", "electronicPublicationDate": "2023-11-29", "firstPublicationDate": "2023-11-29"}
