On the 30th anniversary of ICPD (ICPD+30), the global community of FP stakeholders is still striving to meet individuals&#x02019; sexual and reproductive health (SRH) needs while doing so using person-centered, rights-based approaches and measures of progress.</p><p>As members of the global FP community who work at the world&#x02019;s largest bilateral donor in FP, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), we are taking the opportunity of ICPD+30 to consider what we have learned and where the field is headed. This commentary offers a synthesis of our reflections, beginning with a summary of recent influential shifts impacting FP, followed by a summary of the growing evidence base on the importance of investing in FP, and concluding with a description of USAID&#x02019;s vision for the future&#x02014;a world where ongoing improvements to SRH contribute to longer, healthier, and more prosperous lives for all. To be clear on the scope of USAID&#x02019;s support for SRH within the &#x0201c;FP/reproductive health (RH)&#x0201d; funding earmark in the annual appropriations act, in addition to comprehensive, voluntary FP, USAID also implements activities that address FP integration with HIV/AIDS and maternal health (such as postabortion care); child, early, and forced marriage; gender-based violence (GBV); female genital mutilation/cutting; and fistula. All program-supported FP services are guided by the principles of voluntarism and informed choice. USAID does not fund abortions.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RECENT INFLUENTIAL SHIFTS IMPACTING FAMILY PLANNING: REASONS FOR OPTIMISM AND PESSIMISM</title><p>Since ICPD, the world has taken the opportunity every 5 years to assess progress toward the Programme of Action.

Typically, wealth status has been used as a key identifier of these inequities.<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr"><sup>66</sup></xref> A more holistic approach is now recommended, guided in part by the USAID-supported High Impact Practices partnership, which suggests using data from the DHS and other population-based surveys to identify inequities across dimensions of availability, accessibility, and quality by disaggregating by age, education, marital status, wealth, residence, religion, and/or ethnic status.<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr"><sup>67</sup></xref> Recent work extended the framing of equity to include disability status, as well as sexual and gender minority status,<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr"><sup>68</sup></xref> with recognition that more work is required to ensure that FP programs are meeting the needs of everyone.<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr"><sup>69</sup></xref> Here, we intentionally use the word &#x0201c;everyone,&#x0201d; as it would be careless to only mention FP in the context of women and girls. Male engagement in FP, as supportive partners and contraceptive users, is a key component of gender transformative FP programming that &#x0201c;recognizes gender norms and inequalities, challenges and addresses them, and seeks solutions to overcome them.&#x0201d;<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr"><sup>70</sup></xref> Further, in recent years, global recognition of the importance of expanding access to people belonging to sexual and gender minority groups has grown exponentially, as has advocacy for FP programs to address the needs of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex populations.<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr"><sup>71</sup></xref> Equity for these populations requires good foundational data, and the USAID-supported DHS Program is currently exploring how to safely and in a standardized fashion, include sexual and gender minority-related topics in surveys, building, in part, from lessons learned when DHS worked with the Washington Group on Disability Statistics to develop the disability questionnaire module in 2016.<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr"><sup>72</sup></xref> The DHS Program is also exploring new ways of capturing GBV in surveys, including emerging routes of technology-facilitated GBV. These are small examples of big steps USAID is taking to understand and, thus, design interventions for what the global community lumps together as &#x0201c;underserved and marginalized communities.&#x0201d; If the adage &#x0201c;what gets measured gets done&#x0201d; has any relevance to the ICPD Programme of Action, it&#x02019;s this aspect of shining a light on who is unmeasured, and understanding who these communities are in all their diversity to truly create a more inclusive future. Indeed, there is great potential in harnessing technology to reach or amplify outreach to groups that may be missed in traditional surveys or population registers. This includes adolescents and youth, who may be more likely to engage with FP and health messaging via video games and direct-to-consumer approaches or by using convenient self-care FP methods.<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr"><sup>73</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="s3.5"><title>Partnership</title><p>Finally, we examine FP&#x02019;s role toward advancing the &#x0201c;partnership&#x0201d; SDG theme. In recent years, a global consensus has been affirmed and reaffirmed, including in a donor statement penned by USAID and 3 dozen bilateral donors and foundations, that success for all donor-supported programs (not just FP) hinges upon intentional collaboration and cooperation between donors and the people, institutions, and communities who address and are impacted by these challenges every day.<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr"><sup>74</sup></xref> USAID and other donors are embracing localization strategies, which include shifting power, directly channeling funding to local actors, and more.<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Whether partnership takes the form of costed implementation plans developed through a strategic government-led consultative process that results in a detailed plan for program activities and an estimate of the funding required to achieve an established set of goals<xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr"><sup>75</sup></xref> or a more comprehensive approach that includes capacity-strengthening, social behavior change, or data demand,<xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr"><sup>76</sup></xref> donors must remain agile to respond to country needs. This is sometimes easier said than done, given stagnant or dwindling budgets and shifting donor priorities, which may lead to unpredictability disruptive to partner country planning and implementation, as revealed in a recent analysis of aid in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia.<xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr"><sup>77</sup></xref> Despite these challenges, partnership is and must continue to be the cornerstone of FP assistance programs. Indeed, global partnerships that engage multilaterals, private organizations, and governments alike, such as FP2030 and the Ouagadougou Partnership, have been and remain key to accelerating country-led FP goals. <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr"><sup>78</sup></xref></p><boxed-text position="float"><p>A global consensus has been reaffirmed that success for all donor-supported programs (not just FP) hinges upon intentional collaboration and cooperation between donors and the people, institutions, and communities who address and are impacted by these challenges every day.</p></boxed-text></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>LOOKING TO THE FUTURE</title><p>Since the 25th anniversary of ICPD, USAID has made great strides in accelerating its commitment to localization while ensuring no one is left behind.<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> As we have illustrated, FP is a necessary component of sustainable development. USAID&#x02019;s ongoing support for this important contribution to SRH remains steadfast. Given the state of research and discussions we have outlined and recognizing that the ICPD Programme of Action remains an enduring vision and approach with goals yet to be achieved, USAID continues to uphold the principles of agency, quality, equity, and inclusion into its SRH and development programs. Recognizing that advancing the Programme of Action requires interventions within and beyond FP,<xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr"><sup>79</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr"><sup>80</sup></xref> USAID&#x02019;s Primary Impact initiative accelerates progress in health and survival through investment in primary health care,<xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr"><sup>81</sup></xref> a key step in reducing maternal mortality. In collaboration with partners around the world, USAID is also contributing to redefining &#x0201c;success&#x0201d; and how it is measured and is continually exploring how best to meet the varied and expanding SRH needs in our dynamic world. Take, for instance, several recent examples from Zambia, Nigeria, and Ethiopia.</p><p>In Zambia, vague policies on age of consent for FP services limit adolescents&#x02019; access to and use of FP services, which contributes to high adolescent pregnancy rates, high maternal and child mortality rates, and constrained educational and economic opportunities for first-time parents.<xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr"><sup>82</sup></xref> USAID is working with the Government of Zambia and local partners to leverage Zambia&#x02019;s otherwise strong FP program, including its sound commodity security plan, to address adolescent SRH needs. This includes taking a total market approach to expand access to contraceptives and FP services via the private sector and partnering with local stakeholders to encourage policy reform.</p><p>In Nigeria, USAID works closely with the government-led National RH Technical Working Group to advance an evidence-based expansion of the contraceptive method mix. USAID, alongside other donors, supported the Government of Nigeria to introduce and scale up new and underutilized methods to broaden the range of contraceptive choices. Similarly, in alignment with the global FP community&#x02019;s shift to person-centered, rights-based programs that promote individual and collective reproductive empowerment and agency, the Government of Nigeria (in one of the first instances globally of adapting the World Health Organization guidelines), with USAID support, issued national guidelines on self-care for sexual, reproductive, and maternal health,<xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr"><sup>83</sup></xref> including a focus on FP self-care. USAID/Nigeria plans continued support for the contextualized implementation of FP High Impact Practices, especially those that integrate a full range of FP methods into antenatal, labor and delivery, and postpartum care and expand access to FP self-care.</p><p>In Ethiopia, innovative financing approaches have helped the country make progress in FP outcomes, with learnings for other health areas. Following the Ministry of Health&#x02019;s call for support to address funding gaps for FP commodity procurement, USAID/Ethiopia collaborated with the Ministry of Health, other development partners, and key stakeholders to increase domestic financing for FP and RH commodity procurement and for improved quality of FP services. This collaborative effort led to the signing of a compact agreement between the Government of Ethiopia and other development partners to co-finance FP commodity procurement through a matching fund from the Government&#x02019;s treasury with a total amount of about US$36 million for 3 years (2023&#x02013;2025). The Government of Ethiopia&#x02019;s commitment to increasingly co-finance FP commodity procurement came when the country&#x02019;s fiscal space was highly constrained and reserve funds were hugely depleted due to the conflict in Northern Ethiopia. The Government has committed financing of 25%, 50%, and 85% of total contributions for the first 3 years, respectively. This is a big step toward the realization of the country&#x02019;s FP2030 commitment. The government of Ethiopia now recognizes this cost-share approach as a promising funding arrangement for other health programs.</p><p>Looking to the future, USAID&#x02019;s <italic toggle="yes">Pathways to Progress for Sexual and Reproductive Health</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">2024&#x02013;2030</italic><xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr"><sup>84</sup></xref> builds on long-standing commitments.

<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Individuals have accurate information, skills, and ability to take action to achieve the highest attainable levels of SRH across their lifetime.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Health systems provide quality, accessible, and people-centered SRH care.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Local communities, organizations, institutions, and governments create and foster social norms and policies that support individuals to make and act on their own SRH decisions, free from violence, coercion, and discrimination.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Through the principles and strategies outlined in Pathways, USAID commits to recalibrating its FP/RH program to accelerate progress and address gaps. This evolution is grounded in evidence-based strategies focused on meeting individuals&#x02019; SRH needs by championing reproductive agency, strengthening quality health systems, and fostering supportive social norms and policies. By enacting these commitments and strengthening collaboration with partner countries and donors alike, USAID can help shape a world where ongoing improvements to SRH contribute to longer, healthier, and more prosperous lives for all. These collective efforts will garner transformational benefits to women, families, communities, and countries by accelerating progress across the 5 SDG themes of people, planet, prosperity, peace, and partnership while bringing us closer to the bold, people-centered vision described 3 decades ago in the ICPD Programme of Action.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This article benefited from initial literature searches by Sonia Rao while she was an intern at the U.S. Agency for International Development.</p></ack><ack><title>Disclaimer</title><p>This article was produced and prepared independently by the authors.
