A central tenet of the concept of environmental and climate justice is that environmental and climate issues cannot be seen in isolation from issues of social justice.<h4>Methods</h4>A conceptual model was developed on the relationship between climate change impacts, social dimensions, adaptive capacities, biological sensitivity, and health equity in order to systematically analyse climate justice. Based on an exploratory literature review and the evaluation of the individual contributions of the status report on climate change and health, the evidence in Germany on social inequalities in exposure to climate change impacts and vulnerability to their direct and indirect health effects was summarised.<h4>Results</h4>This paper provides an overview of the international debate and examples of evidence on climate justice in Germany. Climate justice in the sense of avoidable, unjust social inequalities in exposure, vulnerability, and the effects of climate mitigation and adaptation measures on health inequalities is still insufficiently addressed in Germany.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A consistent integration of equity issues into climate policy is necessary. With reference to the international literature, options for action and research needs are identified.", "affiliation": "University of Bremen, Institute of Public Health and Nursing Research, Department of Social Epidemiology, Bremen, Germany.", "publicationStatus": "epublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Electronic-eCollection", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Environmental Justice", "Health Equity", "Health Equity In All Policies"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.25646/11772"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC10722520"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC10722520?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "5", "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "N", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2023-12-18", "firstIndexDate": "2023-12-22", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2023-12-18", "dateOfRevision": "2023-12-19", "electronicPublicationDate": "2023-11-29", "firstPublicationDate": "2023-11-29"}
