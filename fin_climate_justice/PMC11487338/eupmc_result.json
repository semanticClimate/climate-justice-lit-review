Formal concept analysis can promote unified conceptualisation to inform sustainability integration in nursing curriculums.<h4>Objective</h4>Analyse the concept of 'nursing education for sustainable development' using the Walker and Avant framework to clarify meaning and application in nursing programmes.<h4>Method</h4>The literature was systematically searched for attributes, antecedents and consequences used to formulate a concept definition, and compared to existing conceptualisations.<h4>Results</h4>Core concept attributes are interconnectedness of human/ecological health, sustainability-focused curriculums, competency cultivation and social justice orientations. Antecedents include recognising ecological determinants of health and committed nursing faculty. Consequences encompass the preparation of sustainability-competent nurses and elevated nursing contributions to sustainable health systems.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The concept analysis provides an original synthesised perspective advancing coherence and applicability to guide sustainability education in nursing programmes through a translational framework for competency, curriculum design and content delivery approaches.<h4>Reporting method</h4>We followed the guidelines outlined in the Walker and Avant framework in the conduct and reporting of this paper.<h4>Patient or public contribution</h4>No patient and public contribution.", "affiliation": "Department of Health Administration and Education, University of Education, Winneba, Ghana.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["review-article", "Review", "Journal Article"]}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Humans"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Concept Formation"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Curriculum", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "TD", "qualifierName": "trends", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Education, Nursing"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Sustainable Development"}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Sustainable Development", "Nursing Education", "Concept Analysis", "Curriculum Integration"]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "Unpaywall", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/nop2.70058"}, {"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/nop2.70058"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC11487338"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC11487338?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "N", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2024-10-18", "dateOfCreation": "2024-10-18", "firstIndexDate": "2024-10-19", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2024-10-31", "dateOfRevision": "2024-10-20", "firstPublicationDate": "2024-10-01"}
