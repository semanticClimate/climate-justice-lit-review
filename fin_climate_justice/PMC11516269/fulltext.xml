Bibliographic databases Medline and Embase were searched from inception to May 2024 with MESH terms for heatwaves/extreme heat and mortality. This was complemented with hand-searching of reference lists of relevant studies. The methodological quality of eligible studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool.</p></sec><sec id="s849"><title>Results</title><p>In total, 931 studies were identified, of which 32 studies were included in the qualitative review and 11 in the meta-analysis. Most studies (20/32) reported a higher risk of heat-related death for women than men even after adjusting for or stratifying by age. Twelve studies showed statistically significant higher risks of death for women than men and 7 studies identified an increased risk of death for women, but the wide confidence intervals precluded making definite conclusions. Two studies reported a higher risk of death for men in comparison to women but only one was statistically significant. The remaining 10 studies found comparable risks for women and men. For the 11 studies included in the meta-analysis, women had an 8% increased risk of death in comparison to men (RR 1.08, 95% CI [1.02 to 1.14]). There was significant heterogeneity (I2=69%, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001) due to the variability in the definition of exposure, population, and setting. Most studies had a low to moderate risk of bias.</p></sec><sec id="s850"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Women appeared to have an increased risk of death associated with heatwaves in comparison to men. Further research is warranted to understand the underlying factors and ensure the health protection response considers the gendered impact of heatwaves.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="2"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
