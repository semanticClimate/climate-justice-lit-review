Accordingly, medical schools must incorporate education on the impacts of climate change on health and equity into their curricula.

First-year medical students at Duke University School of Medicine participated in seven mandatory foundational lectures and two experiential learning opportunities in the local community.

With the inevitable health consequences arising from climate change, medical students will interact with affected patients during their training and careers. Students are increasingly aware that the very healthcare systems they are members of contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions underlying anthropogenic climate change [<xref rid="pone.0303615.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0303615.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Moreover, while all individuals may be affected, communities that are historically marginalized, medically underserved, and older are at higher risk of experiencing the health impacts of climate change due to structural inequities [<xref rid="pone.0303615.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0303615.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. At present, medical schools have both an opportunity and a responsibility to promote action-oriented learning in undergraduate medical education (UME) at the intersection of climate change and health.</p><p>In 2015, over one hundred health professional schools signed the Health Educator&#x02019;s Climate Commitment, an international pledge to train the next generation of health professionals to care for patients impacted by climate change [<xref rid="pone.0303615.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Medical schools are responding by incorporating climate change topics into UME. From 2019 to 2022, the Liaison Committee on Medical Education reported that the percentage of medical schools providing climate change instruction more than doubled from 27% to 55% [<xref rid="pone.0303615.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition to learning the facts and diagnoses related to climate change, medical students are uniquely situated to be &#x0201c;agents of change&#x0201d; by identifying, researching, and advocating for climate resilience, environmental justice, and health equity [<xref rid="pone.0303615.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0303615.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Education on climate change&#x02019;s effects on health has the potential to be transformative, allowing students and educators to synthesize factual information, reflect on content beyond the classroom, and evoke commitment to personal and professional behavior change.</p><p>However, UME faces challenges with incorporating climate concepts into curricula. Recurring barriers include competition for time, space, and faculty in the existing curriculum [<xref rid="pone.0303615.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0303615.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Climate change and its health impacts are also new topics for medical educators. Building teaching capacity, assessing resources, and integrating new material into existing content necessitate time and associated administrative and financial support [<xref rid="pone.0303615.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0303615.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Finally, there is a dearth of robust assessments to evaluate student learning. Assessments are critical as they signal learning priorities to students, confirm knowledge acquisition and behavior change, and facilitate sharing of successful interventions across programs and institutions [<xref rid="pone.0303615.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0303615.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0303615.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0303615.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Thought leaders have recommended learning objectives for climate change and health education, and suggested when and how to deliver content and assessments within existing educational frameworks [<xref rid="pone.0303615.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0303615.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>In fall 2022, faculty members and trainees met to address the lack of UME at our institution, Duke University School of Medicine (DUSOM), focused on climate change and its health impacts. Subsequently, we created a community of practice (CoP) of educators and students. The CoP&#x02019;s purpose was to identify areas within the first-year medical curriculum where topics of climate change could be integrated and to then develop a curricular thread in the first-year medical program with clear objectives and measurable outcomes. The resulting curricular thread was named Climate Change, Health, and Equity.</p><p>The goal of the Climate Change, Health, and Equity thread was to develop medical students&#x02019; critical consciousness&#x02013;an awareness of the impact climate change has on health that overcomes preexisting biases and is liberated from others&#x02019; beliefs [<xref rid="pone.0303615.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition to foundational lectures, we intended to foster the growth of medical students&#x02019; critical consciousness using facilitated discussions, self-reflection and writing exercises, and experiential learning activities focused on informed advocacy, personal accountability, and environmental health justice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Needs assessment and creation of the community of practice</title><p>In fall 2022, faculty members and students of the DUSOM met to identify opportunities to integrate climate change and its health impacts within the UME. The meeting resulted in the creation of an interdisciplinary CoP of medical administrators, educators, students; faculty from the Nicholas School of the Environment, Schools of Nursing and Medicine, Center for Bioethics, Humanities, and History of Medicine, and Medical Center Library; community educators from the Museum of Life and Science, the Nasher Museum of Art, and Moms Clean Air Force. Importantly, the CoP&#x02019;s medical educators included course directors of the first-year curriculum and medical students of all years, including student-leaders of the DUSOM Sustainability Committee and Environmental Justice and Health Equity Student Group. The CoP was tasked to develop and pilot a curricular thread, named Climate Change, Healthy and Equity, in the first-year Doctor of Medicine (MD) program by spring 2023.</p><p>Kern&#x02019;s six step approach to curriculum development was used to establish a needs assessment and a framework [<xref rid="pone.0303615.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

Learning objectives were mapped to cognitive, affective, and psychomotor learning domains.</p><p>The curricular thread lectures were designed to provide an overview of climate change and health for all medical students. Students in the CoP also voiced the need for self-reflection activities and experiential learning opportunities that would highlight the pressing nature of climate change on the surrounding community&#x02019;s health and serve as tangible reasons to continue self-directed learning and informed advocacy beyond the curricular thread.</p><p>The main goals of Climate Change, Health, and Equity thread became to have medical students (1) understand the basic concepts of the planetary health framework [<xref rid="pone.0303615.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]; (2) identify effects of climate change on physical and mental health; (3) describe climate change as a social driver of health in the local community; (4) recognize examples of how climate policy disproportionately affects the health and equity of communities of color and of lower socioeconomic status; (5) recognize the importance of and learn from the lived experiences of communities disproportionately affected by climate change; (6) identify opportunities to advocate and partner with patients, community members, and policymakers to promote health equity and climate resilience; and (7) establish personal and professional accountability for continued self-directed learning.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Thread development</title><p>After assessing the current first-year curriculum, the Climate Change, Health, and Equity thread was embedded into the required 21-week Foundations of Patient Care 2 (FPC2) course in the spring 2023 semester.

The objective of the session was to teach students how to effectively search interdisciplinary and subject-specific databases to identify literature on climate change and its health impacts and locate clinical decision-making tools. Following completion of the session, students were tasked with completing a self-directed learning activity in which they independently accessed, selected, and critically analyzed a primary literature source examining a lived experience related to climate. This activity aligned with LCME standard 6.3 for Self-Directed and Lifelong Learning [<xref rid="pone.0303615.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and the findings will be reported in a separate paper.</p><p>For the two experiential learning activities in the community, members of the CoP organized guided tours and presentations at the Museum of Life and Science and Nasher Museum of Art. Students were guided through special exhibits on the climate crisis. The goal of the tour was to stimulate perspective-taking by considering the diverse lived experiences within local, national, and global communities and imagining the impact of climate change on the health of subjects within art pieces and installations. Opportunities for extracurricular involvement were advertised in-class and by email, and included symposiums hosted by national and local organizations and volunteer events with the Environmental Justice and Health Equity Student Group.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Assessment</title><p>At the conclusion of the thread, students were given two prompts designed by the CoP and intended to probe changes in preexisting beliefs and attitudes, motivation to continue learning about climate change as a social driver of health, and likelihood of participating in advocacy and community engagement. All students were required to submit a 500-word critical reflection essay. Study author SK discussed the Reflection, Evaluation for Learners&#x02019; Enhanced Competencies Tool (REFLECT) rubric with students prior to the essay assignment and shared examples modeling reflective writing [<xref rid="pone.0303615.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Prompt 1 was &#x0201c;Many individuals already <italic toggle="yes">recognize</italic> the importance of advocating for environmental justice and can <italic toggle="yes">intellectualize</italic> the collective responsibility needed to create change.

Submitted essays were deidentified and assigned a number. A random number generator identified 30 numbers, and the corresponding essays were used in the analysis. Study authors TD and EA graded the selected essays according to the REFLECT rubric. As a standard setting practice, TD and EA reviewed four essays blindly and then together. The remaining essays were reviewed and graded independently; scores for each criterion were then averaged. Similarly, study authors SM and PM, who are trained in narrative medicine, performed the thematic analysis of the selected essays. Study author SM is a faculty member at DUSOM but not directly involved in this thread, and PM is a faculty member at an external United States health sciences university. SM and PM reviewed five essays together to develop a codebook. The remaining essays were reviewed and coded independently. Themes were organized according to Bloom&#x02019;s Taxonomy into cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains and further classified according to the socio-ecological model for health promotion into individual, institutional, societal/community, and policy factors [<xref rid="pone.0303615.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0303615.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Study approval</title><p>The Duke University Institutional Review Board determined data collected for the Climate Change, Health, and Equity curricular thread was exempted educational research.

At the individual level, students commented on newly gained vocabulary, knowledge about pathology related to heat, air quality, and infectious diseases, and perspectives on the effects of climate change on individual-level disparities. At the institutional level, students discussed how the medical field&#x02019;s carbon footprint contributes to climate change and how spikes in emergency visits tend to correlate with heat exposure. Students reflected on the importance of understanding the effects of climate change on the communities they are members of. Many also described how community-level health disparities they knew about previously (e.g. redlining, mental health) were linked to climate change, effectively appraising and re-evaluating their prior assumptions. Students recognized that inaction at the policy-level would contribute to widespread problems despite changes at the individual, institutional, and societal levels. They offered solutions based on their synthesized knowledge such as posing fiscal penalties on companies creating environmental hazards and taking measures for resilience and adaptation.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Affective domain</title><p>Nearly all students (27/30; 90%) addressed the affective domain in their essays (<xref rid="pone.0303615.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). At the individual level, students recalled experiencing or noticing the consequences of climate change both personally and professionally in clinical settings. Students used emotionally laden words when describing their feelings on climate change mitigation efforts, including &#x0201c;dismay&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;insurmountable&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;paralyzed by fear&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;powerlessness,&#x0201d; and directed negative emotions towards the healthcare system. Students voiced critiques of this curricular thread and areas for improvement but also expressed a sense of solidarity after participating in the curricular thread alongside peers and the CoP. From the museum exhibits, students reflected on the affective importance of including perspectives that are often excluded from conversations centered around the environment, including Indigenous peoples, urban residents, and rural farmworkers. Finally, concern and anxiety regarding the lack of policy addressing climate change and its downstream effects on human health were frequently discussed.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Psychomotor (action) domain</title><p>Nearly every essay (24/30; 80%) included statements expressing the need for action (<xref rid="pone.0303615.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) at the individual level (e.g. using reusable grocery bags, volunteering for creek clean-ups, talking to patients about climate change during interviews) and/or the institutional level (e.g. using light-emitting diode (LED) rather than incandescent lights, promoting sustainable transport services). Several students indicated a desire to continue learning about climate change and planetary health, through local grassroots organizations and patient-centric tools such as the Durham Neighborhood Compass, a local database that maps demographic, environmental, and health statistics according to zip code. The students conveyed that utilizing these tools could allow them to ask patients relevant questions and offer appropriate resources. Lastly, students acknowledged the power of collective influence and the sense of responsibility they felt following participation in the curricular thread to advocate for climate change policy and to vote for policies that mitigate harm to human health.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec015"><title>Discussion</title><p>The Climate Change, Health, and Equity curricular thread united educators, students, and relevant community members to address the challenges of time and space in the UME in delivering content on climate change and its health impacts. Through dynamic conversations centered on the current and future impacts of climate change on health, we created foundational lectures, guided discussions, organized experiences in the community, and facilitated self-reflection on learner&#x02019;s attitudes and beliefs. This multi-pronged approach ultimately led students to express both the need for action and their desire to further learn from the lived experiences of patients affected by climate change in their self-reflection essays. Uniquely, we included self-reflection and experiential learning activities after students in the CoP voiced that seeing tangible effects of climate change on the health of communities may invoke desires to continue learning and advocating beyond the curricular thread.</p><p>We drew on Mezirow&#x02019;s transformative learning theory by establishing a learning environment that exposed students to dilemmas posed by climate change, examined preexisting belief systems, cultivated learning and perspectives, shared sentiments through discussion and critical reflection, and explored skills needed for successful reintegration in a transformed reality [<xref rid="pone.0303615.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We applied Freire&#x02019;s educational learning theory to develop students&#x02019; critical consciousness through creation of a communal learning environment where the teacher and learner become equals who learn from one another and the world around them [<xref rid="pone.0303615.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0303615.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Utilizing a learning approach that incorporated engagement with the community brought forth the first-hand perspectives of individuals facing social, political, and economic realities of climate change. In doing so, we adhered to an essential component of Freire&#x02019;s theory of connecting the learners to the &#x0201c;others&#x0201d; about whom they are learning. By taking students outside of the classroom, we challenged students to disentangle biases derived from traditional narratives learned secondhand and to reframe their views based on primary accounts.</p><p>Assessments were an essential component of our thread and served two purposes. First, our evaluation tools addressed the general challenge in medical education that new innovations often lack systematic assessment. Second, our evaluation helped us determine if students were exploring their critical consciousness. The reflection essays revealed that content delivery was effective as students reported an increased cognitive understanding of the climate&#x02019;s impact on health. This was further contextualized by affective growth wherein students were able to connect new knowledge with existing frameworks and emotional responses. Although developing critical consciousness is a continuous process, the nearly unanimous reflections in the affective and psychomotor domains focused on responsibility and action highlight the impact our thread had on promoting introspection.</p><p>For future directions, we plan to measure the long-term impact of the thread on knowledge and action. Longitudinal follow-up is especially critical as our school&#x02019;s curriculum consists of only a single pre-clerkship year. Our cohort was limited to these first-year students, and we did not have a control group of students to compare reflection outcomes to. After completing future clerkships, the first-year students who participated in this thread may rethink what they have learned about climate change and health and reconsider the practicality of the behaviors and actions described in their reflections. For example, several students wanted to incorporate climate counseling into patient encounters. Follow-up after completion of the clerkships will elucidate whether counseling was feasible, and if not, what were the encountered challenges that could be addressed.</p><p>Experts have highlighted that sustainability and climate awareness are core values akin to professionalism and ethics that should be incorporated throughout training using a variety of teaching modalities as a theme rather than as standalone topics [<xref rid="pone.0303615.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0303615.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. To this end, we are considering how to expand the Climate Change, Health, and Equity thread to weave throughout years of the UME. We plan to track how climate impacts on health are taught intentionally or encountered as part of the hidden UME curriculum.</p><p>Several students wanted even more diverse perspectives and a greater understanding of the impact that institutional, state, and federal policies have had on environmental justice locally. We will incorporate this feedback in future thread iterations, especially as planetary health and environmental justice encompasses efforts of all allied health professionals. Accordingly, we recommend that institutions with multiple professional schools should work towards an interprofessional framework.</p><p>Although our study was conducted at a single institution during a single year, we developed our thread such that it could be readily adapted at other health professional programs. We recognize that the impacts of climate change and resulting inequities have regional differences, such as distribution of infectious disease, and community-specific variation based on pre-existing conditions of the local population, the nearby environment, and risk exposure [<xref rid="pone.0303615.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Other health professional programs can adapt the didactic materials and the experiential community-based activities to provide meaningful learning opportunities that can be tailored locally [<xref rid="pone.0303615.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0303615.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. For example, the Museum of Life and Science and Nasher Museum of Art tours that were organized for this thread could be exchanged for immersive, creative experiences at neighborhood community centers disproportionately affected by climate change, local farms and food distribution and recovery programs, waste and treatment facilities, and fieldwork sites to appreciate how environmental health is surveilled. These experiences would provide health professional students opportunities to learn about local planetary health priorities and to reflect critically on practices back in traditional training spaces.</p><p>We view the education provided by the Climate Change, Health, and Equity thread as imperative to medical students&#x02019; education, personal growth, and professional responsibility to their patients. We will continue developing our first-year thread by incorporating insights gained from this cohort, extending educational activities into subsequent years of UME, and partnering with allied health professional programs and institutions.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0303615.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Eckelman</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Lagasse</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Senay</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Dubrow</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Sherman</surname><given-names>JD</given-names></name>. <article-title>Health Care Pollution And Public Health Damage In The United States: An Update.</article-title>

</p><p>2. Note from Emily Chenette, Editor in Chief of PLOS ONE, and Iain Hrynaszkiewicz, Director of Open Research Solutions at PLOS: Did you know that depositing data in a repository is associated with up to a 25% citation advantage (<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0230416" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0230416</ext-link>)? If you&#x02019;ve not already done so, consider depositing your raw data in a repository to ensure your work is read, appreciated and cited by the largest possible audience. You&#x02019;ll also earn an Accessible Data icon on your published paper if you deposit your data in any participating repository (<ext-link xlink:href="https://plos.org/open-science/open-data/#accessible-data" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/open-science/open-data/#accessible-data</ext-link>).</p><p>3. Please provide additional details regarding participant consent. In the ethics statement in the Methods and online submission information, please ensure that you have specified (1) whether consent was informed and (2) what type you obtained (for instance, written or verbal, and if verbal, how it was documented and witnessed). If your study included minors, state whether you obtained consent from parents or guardians. If the need for consent was waived by the ethics committee, please include this information.</p><p>If you are reporting a retrospective study of medical records or archived samples, please ensure that you have discussed whether all data were fully anonymized before you accessed them and/or whether the IRB or ethics committee waived the requirement for informed consent. If patients provided informed written consent to have data from their medical records used in research, please include this information</p><p>Once you have amended this/these statement(s) in the Methods section of the manuscript, please add the same text to the &#x0201c;Ethics Statement&#x0201d; field of the submission form (via &#x0201c;Edit Submission&#x0201d;).</p><p>For additional information about PLOS ONE ethical requirements for human subjects research, please refer to <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-human-subjects-research" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/submission-guidelines#loc-human-subjects-research</ext-link>.</p><p>4. We note that your Data Availability Statement is currently as follows: [All relevant data are within the manuscript and its Supporting Information files.]</p><p>Please confirm at this time whether or not your submission contains all raw data required to replicate the results of your study. Authors must share the &#x0201c;minimal data set&#x0201d; for their submission. PLOS defines the minimal data set to consist of the data required to replicate all study findings reported in the article, as well as related metadata and methods (<ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-minimal-data-set-definition" ext-link-type="uri">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability#loc-minimal-data-set-definition</ext-link>).</p><p>For example, authors should submit the following data:</p><p>- The values behind the means, standard deviations and other measures reported;</p><p>- The values used to build graphs;</p><p>- The points extracted from images for analysis.</p><p>Authors do not need to submit their entire data set if only a portion of the data was used in the reported study.</p><p>If your submission does not contain these data, please either upload them as Supporting Information files or deposit them to a stable, public repository and provide us with the relevant URLs, DOIs, or accession numbers.

It is unclear how much of this one example is applicable generally, since a unique feature of the effort at this institution is that the existing course directors played a key part in introducing new content.</p><p>More importantly, the information about the course may be too scant to be useful. And not enough detail warrants much more detail, which isn&#x02019;t feasible in this sort of paper. I would thus streamline the paper to the crucial, transferable content, eliminating details that are not relevant to the overall architecture of the course, which will also make this paper more readable. I hope that my specific comments can provide some additional guidance.</p><p>Of note, the writing could use the librarian&#x02019;s once-over. &#x0201c;At present&#x0201d; not &#x0201c;presently&#x0201d;. &#x0201c;Effect&#x0201d; not &#x0201c;affect&#x0201d;; &#x0201c;synthesize: not &#x0201c;synthesize ..together&#x0201d; etc. And that&#x02019;s just the opening section</p><p>p. 1 &#x0201c;surrounding environment&#x0201d; This is vague and can be anything. Please be clear about what aspects of the surrounding environment you mean, as this orients your argument.</p><p>p. 2</p><p>Building teaching capacity&#x02026; financial support&#x0201d; Consider including:</p><p>Blanchard OA, Greenwald LM, Sheffield PE. The Climate Change Conversation: Understanding Nationwide Medical Education Efforts. Yale J Biol Med. 2023 ;96(2):171-184.</p><p>&#x0201c;Though leaders have recommended learning objectives&#x02026;&#x0201d; Consider including: ]</p><p>Sorensen C. Campbell H, Depoux A. et al. Core Competencies to Prepare Health Professionals to Respond to the Climate Crisis. Plos Climate 2023; 2(6): e0000230.</p><p>&#x0201c;Considering the education need and expert recommendation&#x0201d; It&#x02019;s very important to be precise here, as this represents the transition from the previous general overview/state of climate education to this institution&#x02019;s response. What exactly was the CoP convened to address? Start this paragraph with &#x0201c;In order to address&#x02026;&#x0201d; Then state what the goal of the CoP was (e.g. In order to address the need for a more robust climate curriculum with measurable goals, we&#x02026;&#x0201d;</p><p>How were the learning objectives and goals derived (based on what sources?)</p><p>Materials and institutional expertise: vague</p><p>Assessment tools: Unclear how these were developed, given that no intervention has been developed, according to this description</p><p>Where does the Health and Equity come from? This hasn&#x02019;t been part of the intro. Is this what was meant as part of the &#x02018;education need and expert recommendation?&#x0201d; Also, it is hard to understand how the group, given the authors&#x02019; recognition of all the constraints preventing climate education, managed to get this thread into the curriculum. What seems to be needed here is more focus. Instead of starting the paper with all the problems, why not say something like (in a nutshell): &#x0201c;Although many institutions have confronted difficulties in incorporating climate change awareness into their busy curriculum, our medical school&#x02019;s first-year climate, health, and equity course successfully addressed this barrier by integrating multiple urgent concerns students are confronting today. These include environmental threats, health equity, and [whatever other urgency the thread contains].&#x0201d;</p><p>p. 3 evolves from? You must mean &#x02018;evolves beyond&#x02019; or something like that</p><p>&#x0201c;We intended&#x02026;humanities&#x0201d; The reader recognizes this as a big ask and hopes that what follows will illuminate how these goals were addressed</p><p>p. 4. The power of the course directors is key here; the lack thereof would be a major obstacle at other institutions</p><p>&#x0201c;118 students engaged in thread content&#x0201d;: isn&#x02019;t there a better way to say this? How about: &#x0201c;The course thread included&#x02026;&#x0201d; you can mention the 118 students later, probably not necessary until the results</p><p>&#x0201c;All thread content was developed&#x0201d; It seems as though you are going backwards at best or all over the place at worst. Reorder to state: Who developed thread content, how it was integrated (as lectures etc); and additional content (2 mandatory sessions; 2 community engagement sessions).</p><p>Interactive and community sessions: It is unclear how these matter to the focus of your paper. You say too little about their relevance. I would just mention them, maybe with the briefest possible mention in the context of the overall climate and equity intention of the course. All you need to say without getting into deep water is &#x0201c;Exhibits addressing the [physical and emotional?] impacts of climate change on affected communities were well-suited to provoking thoughtful discussions.&#x0201d;</p><p>Overall: consider what the reader needs to understand about the basic course structure and intent. In terms of all the details, the reader won&#x02019;t have the same local resources you have; if they think they might be able to apply your approach to their own resources, they can contact you.</p><p>It&#x02019;s unclear how beliefs about climate change are a &#x02018;metareflective exercise of their learning.&#x0201d; The reader has no idea from this sentence what your goal is. Also if they were required to write this, how come they had the option to opt out? It sounds contradictory. Maybe: any student who did not choose to opt out was required&#x02026;</p><p>p. 7 There seems to be an overlap between methods and results. Methods should state what the overall plan and process is. The results should state how many people participated, if any did not participate, and what was found.</p><p>Nothing is said about the thematic analysis itself and how it was conducted. See: Kiger ME, Varpio L. Thematic analysis of qualitative data: AMEE Guide No. 131. Med Teach. 2020;42(8):846-854.</p><p>7-8 &#x0201c;For instance, one student connected a lecture statistic regarding the nature of poor air quality ..with environmental pathology&#x02026;&#x0201d; The reader is unlikely to understand what the actual insight here is, so I suggest finding a better, less obscure-sounding example</p><p>&#x0201c;&#x02026;expand their medical knowledge&#x02026;to include a critical review of the literature&#x0201d; It&#x02019;s unclear how the above examples, which are pretty basic, show this. Wouldn&#x02019;t students have heard in their sessions about the disparities mentioned in the quoted material?</p><p>9 &#x0201d;&#x02026;importance of hearing directly from affected communities&#x0201d; It&#x02019;s unclear whether students were asking for such contacts, or whether in the course they had such contacts. Or were they responding to the museum exhibit?</p><p>Psychomotor: It&#x02019;s unclear how much content in the teaching thread addressed actionable items</p><p>10 &#x0201c;Students participated in foundational lectures&#x02026;on attitudes and beliefs&#x0201d; I feel that this should be embedded in the method section or tabulated in the results section. This is not the place to mention this as though it were some sort of concluding insight</p><p>&#x0201c;resulted in calls to action&#x0201d; There is a big difference between calls to action as expressed in an assigned essay vs in an activist format. &#x0201c;Students reflected in their essays on the different ways students could actively engage&#x0201d; seems more accurate. Better yet: &#x0201c;These activities ultimately led students to express a need for action and a desire to learn from the lived experience of patients affected by climate change. Through critical reflection&#x02026;&#x0201d;</p><p>However, I don&#x02019;t think you can claim that students generated a sense of personal &#x00026; professional responsibility&#x02026;etc. The more accurate claim would be that they expressed this sense.</p><p>It&#x02019;s unclear to me how the CoP transformed the topic of climate change. Nothing you describe really supports this. And for whom do you mean? For the first year students or the CoP members? If the latter, you don&#x02019;t show it in the paper. If the former, all we have is the claims in their essays. Maybe the students did express something like &#x0201c;This course really transformed my thinking&#x0201d; but you don&#x02019;t provide evidence of that. If you mean the CoP members, we really don&#x02019;t hear anything in this paper about the impact on them.</p><p>&#x0201c;Holistic educational approach towards addressing inequities&#x02026;&#x0201d; This doesn&#x02019;t seem to have been the goal of this paper as stated in the intro</p><p>&#x0201c;Didactics were augmented&#x02026;etc&#x0201d; Why is this in the discussion? This seems like it should be in methods or not directly relevant to the paper.</p><p>p. 11 What are &#x02018;unanimous reflections?&#x0201d; Do you mean, nearly all participants highlighted the impact the thread had in furthering reflection on the roles of privilege, responsibility and action?</p><p>Future Directions: Condense the first three sentences to &#x02018;long-term impact&#x02019; on knowledge and action, as these plans seem unformed/speculative as yet</p><p>Adapting experiential community-based activities: I don&#x02019;t know if the readers really understand what the authors did in their museum visits. The alternative suggestions are potentially great, but it&#x02019;s not that easy for educators to adapt them, especially without knowing the details of what the specifics of such community exhibits are&#x02014;not to mention in what context they could make demands of this sort on the curriculum. Maybe a Table detailing examples and specific, itemized suggestions would help</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;I commend the authors for their great work on addressing such a timely and relevant topic. Please see some suggestions below:</p><p>Minor grammatical suggestions: Add a comma in the first line of the abstract.</p><p>&#x02026;impact on the environment and health, medical schools...</p><p>Page 1: Education on climate change&#x02019;s affect (change to effect) on health...</p><p>Methods: How and why are 30 essays chosen for thematic analysis? Is 30 a representative number of essays here? Would suggest to add more information regarding this in the methods section.</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#x000a0;1.</p><p>General question -- The invitation from PLOS ONE reads as follows:</p><p>I am inviting you to peer review the following manuscript for PLOS ONE.

</p><p>The Response to Reviewers and Letter have been uploaded as part of the files. I am also including the responses here. I apologize for any formatting errors as these comments were tabulated in the file. </p><p>--------</p><p>Dear Dr. Chenette, </p><p>We are pleased to submit our revised manuscript now entitled, &#x0201c;Development of a curricular thread to foster medical students&#x02019; critical reflection and promote action on climate change, health, and equity.&#x0201d; </p><p>We are greatly appreciative of the comments we received from the three reviewers. As we hope you will see, by incorporating suggestions, we have significantly improved our manuscript. </p><p>Our manuscript focuses on a timely curricular innovation undertaken at our medical school &#x02013; the incorporation of climate change, health, and equity topics into undergraduate medical education. We describe the needs assessment; development of a community of practice; and design and execution of curricular materials, including lectures, discussions, experiential learning opportunities in the community, and a critical reflection essay. A total of 118 first-year medical students participated in the thread and we thoroughly analyzed the critical reflection essays for themes and by the REFLECT rubric. </p><p>While revising this manuscript, we have now included substantial details in our methods and results sections, included suggested citations by the reviewers, and revised the flow of the writing. Most notably, we have 1) added one figure summarizing the results of the critical reflection essays according to the REFLECT rubric and 2) included four tables. The first table outlines all our curricular activities in detail, as requested by the reviewers, including the lecture title, lecturer name and affiliation, learning objectives, and Bloom&#x02019;s Taxonomy domains addressed. The remaining three tables conveys the themes found in the critical reflection essays according to Bloom&#x02019;s Taxonomy and the socio-ecological model. We have included numerous direct quotes to convey the themes and highlight the efficacy that students felt this thread had on their learning, reflection, and growth. We hope that by including all new materials, readers may consider implementing this thread at their own institutions, which is a necessity given the pressing nature of climate change and its health impacts.</p><p>Our findings highlight that medical students synthesize information about climate change into their medical knowledge and can reflect on the affective and actionable elements of climate change in relation to human health. We wish to underscore not only the enthusiasm of students who participated but also the student-driven nature of the thread development itself and writing of this manuscript. Altogether, our curricular thread depicts the fruitful roles the next generation of physicians are taking in further medical education innovations. </p><p>The total word count of our abstract is 296 words. Our manuscript is approximately 3,400 words (excluding abstract, references, tables, figure, and appendix). All authors on this manuscript have contributed substantially to the work including conceptualizing the purpose, reviewing the literature, and writing the manuscript. None have conflicts of interest to declare.</p><p>Sincerely, </p><p>Trisha Dalapati </p><p>Medical Student </p><p>Duke University School of Medicine</p><p>--------</p><p>1. Please ensure that your manuscript meets PLOS ONE's style requirements, including those for file naming.</p><p>We acknowledge that we have reviewed the PLOS ONE style requirements. </p><p>2.

We hope that this manuscript can serve as a guide to creating a similar climate thread at other institutions, lowering the barrier to institute new content, and making it easier for course directors and other institutional leaders to present similar thread content to students.</p><p>For other institutions, we agree that detail is critical for reproducibility and even improvement upon the thread that we have created. For this reason, we have edited the manuscript throughout to emphasize the transferable content. Additionally, we have added more detail to Table 1 (&#x0201c;Overview of curricular thread activities&#x0201d;), which now includes lecturer affiliations, session lengths, as well as objectives, themes, and Bloom&#x02019;s Taxonomy domains addressed by each thread component. We have addressed specific comments below.</p><p>Reviewer #1: </p><p>Of note, the writing could use the librarian&#x02019;s once-over. &#x0201c;At present&#x0201d; not &#x0201c;presently&#x0201d;. &#x0201c;Effect&#x0201d; not &#x0201c;affect&#x0201d;; &#x0201c;synthesize: not &#x0201c;synthesize ..together&#x0201d; etc. And that&#x02019;s just the opening section</p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out these errors. The manuscript has been thoroughly revised for grammar and clarity. </p><p>Reviewer #1: </p><p>p. 1 &#x0201c;surrounding environment&#x0201d; This is vague and can be anything. Please be clear about what aspects of the surrounding environment you mean, as this orients your argument.</p><p>Thank you for this comment.

What exactly was the CoP convened to address? Start this paragraph with &#x0201c;In order to address&#x02026;&#x0201d; Then state what the goal of the CoP was (e.g. In order to address the need for a more robust climate curriculum with measurable goals, we&#x02026;&#x0201d;</p><p>We strongly agree with the reviewer&#x02019;s comment that we were initially not clear nor precise with the goal of the CoP. Therefore, we have revised the paragraph to address this issue:</p><p>&#x0201c;In fall 2022, faculty members and trainees met to address the lack of UME at our institution, Duke University School of Medicine (DUSOM), focused on climate change and its impacts on health. Subsequently, we created a community of practice (CoP) of medical educators and students. The CoP&#x02019;s purpose was to identify areas within the first-year medical curriculum where topics of climate change could be integrated and to then develop a curricular thread in the first-year medical program with clear objectives and measurable outcomes. The resulting curricular thread was named Climate Change, Health, and Equity.&#x0201d;</p><p>Reviewer #1: </p><p>How were the learning objectives and goals derived (based on what sources?)</p><p>In Table 1 (&#x0201c;Overview of Curricular Thread Activities&#x0201d;), we outline the curricular objectives and themes from each activity that was planned for the curricular thread. These learning objectives and goals were based on each lecturer&#x02019;s expertise and were reviewed by the larger CoP. </p><p>Reviewer #1: Materials and institutional expertise: vague</p><p>We greatly thank the reviewer for this comment. We have included information specifying the affiliation of each member of the CoP in the text of the manuscript and included Table 1 to specify the materials, expertise, objectives, and goals used for the curricular thread. </p><p>&#x0201c;In fall 2022, faculty members and students of the DUSOM met to identify opportunities to integrate climate change and its health impacts within the UME. The meeting resulted in the creation of an interdisciplinary CoP of medical administrators, educators, students; faculty from the Nicholas School of the Environment, Schools of Nursing and Medicine, Center for Bioethics, Humanities, and History of Medicine, and Medical Center Library; community educators from the Museum of Life and Science, the Nasher Muse</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0303615.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0303615.s001.docx"/></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="pone.0303615.r003" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0303615.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Grinnell</surname><given-names>Frederick</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2024 Frederick Grinnell</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2024</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Frederick Grinnell</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0303615" id="rel-obj003" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
