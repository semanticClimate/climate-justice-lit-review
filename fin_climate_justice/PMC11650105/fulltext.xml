However, the activities that some people choose to participate in may have negative effects on the environment and the planet. It is important to ensure that when occupational therapists support people in their choices of activities, this does not lead to unequal access to healthy and meaningful occupations of others, now or in the future. That is because occupational therapists also have a responsibility to prevent occupational injustice. Occupational therapy students are the professionals of the future, so it is important to include them in research about this topic. They need to develop skills that allow them to simultaneously make sure that they are delivering person&#x02010;centred care, which is not environmentally detrimental and that does not lead to occupational injustice. Making sure that occupational therapists provide person&#x02010;centred care while also managing risks of occupational injustice may be seen as a profession&#x02010;specific dilemma. In this study, occupational therapy students in the UK completed a survey about their feelings, views, and readiness for managing this dilemma. Results showed that most respondents are concerned about climate change, but do not feel that their occupational therapy education sufficiently prepared them to practise in an environmentally sustainable way. They were asked to propose ideas for addressing this issue, and the article discusses how occupational therapy curricula might be changed in accordance.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-generated"><kwd id="aot12998-kwd-0001">advocacy</kwd><kwd id="aot12998-kwd-0002">climate justice</kwd><kwd id="aot12998-kwd-0003">education</kwd><kwd id="aot12998-kwd-0004">environmental sustainability</kwd><kwd id="aot12998-kwd-0005">ethics</kwd><kwd id="aot12998-kwd-0006">occupational therapy</kwd><kwd id="aot12998-kwd-0007">person&#x02010;centred care</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-0001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute for Health Research

</p></boxed-text><sec id="aot12998-sec-0008"><label>1</label><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Climate change is widely acknowledged as a major threat to human health (Campbell&#x02010;Lendrum et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0005" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>). This anthropogenic crisis (i.e. environmental change that has been either directly or indirectly caused or influenced by human activity) is an unintended outcome of unsustainable human occupations and post&#x02010;industrialist lifestyles (Ikiugu et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The World Health Organisation (WHO) (<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0038" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>) has warned that the impact of climate change on health determinants is expected to cause deaths and damage to essential health&#x02010;determining sectors such as agriculture, water, and sanitation. The likely result can be seen as a climate justice issue with the potential of deepening global and humanitarian inequalities, not least with regard to occupational access and choice; individual and population engagement in unsustainable occupations today are limiting and threatening occupations of current and future generations (Sultana,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). In light of the impacts of climate change on human health and occupation &#x02014; and hence occupational justice &#x02014; the inclusion of environmental sustainability within occupational therapy practice and education is now deemed an ethical professional responsibility (Royal College of Occupational Therapists (RCOT),&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>).</p><p>The ethical nature of the interrelationships between occupation, human health, and climate change are increasingly recognised (Wagman et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Climate injustice refers to the disproportionately greater negative impacts of climate change on economically disadvantaged and vulnerable individuals and communities driven by wealthier countries and individuals (Sultana,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). Climate change poses disproportionately severe threats to the health of the economically disadvantaged and vulnerable (Wagman et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), introducing a direct relationship between environmental sustainability and occupational justice. Drolet et al. (<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) have proposed the term &#x02018;intergenerational occupational justice&#x02019; to describe the inequitable impacts that climate change will have on the occupational rights of future generations, due to the unsustainable lifestyles of current generations. This connection between climate justice and occupational justice underpins the ethical responsibility for occupational therapists to become environmental sustainability advocates (Garcia Diaz &#x00026; Richardson, <xref rid="aot12998-bib-0040" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; World Federation of Occupational Therapists,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), with the adoption of political and activist characteristics to the professional identity of occupational therapists' professional identity (Pollard &#x00026; Sakellariou,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>According to the World Federation of Occupational Therapists (WFOT) (<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>: p17), sustainable occupational therapy practice necessitates (i) exploring social, economic, environmental and spiritual determinants as part of prevention of ill&#x02010;health; (ii) empowering and enabling people to be drivers of their wellbeing and impact on communities; and (iii) eliminating waste and use of low carbon alternatives in service delivery. As environmental sustainability advocates, occupational therapists can use a variety of lobbying actions within health systems to facilitate the sustainable meeting of human occupational needs, including actions relating to exploration, empowerment, and elimination, as described above by the WFOT (Dhillon et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; WFOT,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). In this role, occupational therapists should use their understanding of the political influences on human occupations to take deliberate and observable actions to create and protect equitable opportunities for occupational engagement across context and time (Pollard &#x00026; Sakellariou,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Hart et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). However, multiple challenges hinder the adoption of sustainable occupational therapy practices. These include a limited evidence base (Lieb, <xref rid="aot12998-bib-0048" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), under&#x02010;recognition of the profession's environmental sustainability efforts (Wagman et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), and lack of clarity of what is meant by the term &#x02018;sustainability&#x02019; in the context of occupational therapy practice (Hocking &#x00026; Kroksmark, <xref rid="aot12998-bib-0044" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Jenkin et al., <xref rid="aot12998-bib-0046" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Indeed, the WFOT&#x000a0;(<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>: p1), noted that, &#x02018;it is the challenge for occupational therapists to enable human development and individual well&#x02010;being whilst promoting environmentally sustainable well&#x02010;being&#x02019;.</p><p>Furthermore, occupational therapists are human too; they are also subject to potential incongruence between theoretical belief and practical action. This phenomenon has been explored by Argyris, Putnam, and Smith&#x000a0;(<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>, p.82), who proposed a difference between ideal and actual actions, namely a misalignment between &#x02018;espouse theory&#x02019; (theories individuals claim to follow) and &#x02018;theory in use&#x02019; (theories that are inferred by actions taken). This difference might explain why occupational therapists remain unsure how to practise sustainably (Seville et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>), despite the World Federation of Occupational Therapy's publication of a profession specific guide for sustainable occupational therapy practice and education more than half a decade ago (WFOT,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). According to WFOT principle 5 (developing professional competence for administering occupation&#x02010;based interventions to address sustainability issues), ongoing engagement to optimise one's knowledge, skills, and attitudes is an essential aspect of developing professional competence (2018: p36). As this continuous journey begins in pre&#x02010;registration occupational therapy education, students' actual and perceived preparedness for this vital responsibility is the foundation from which the gap between &#x02018;espouse theory&#x02019; and &#x02018;theory in use&#x02019; (Argyris et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>) can be reduced.</p><p>This ethical responsibility introduces a need to reconcile between individualist and collectivist views (Komatsu et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Person&#x02010;centred care is a long&#x02010;standing foundational principle within occupational therapy practice, part of the core ethical values and responsibilities for practitioners (American Occupational Therapy Association,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; WFOT,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Yet the notion of person&#x02010;centeredness has been questioned due to its Western, individualistic ideological origin (Restall &#x00026; Egan,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>), with arguments raised that this concept and its associated occupational therapy frameworks disproportionately prioritise individual occupations and are thus inadequate to address the challenges posed by climate change (Gerlach et al., <xref rid="aot12998-bib-0042" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Taff et al., <xref rid="aot12998-bib-0050" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Whalley Hammell (<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0052" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), among others, highlighted the importance of applying a critical perspective to widely accepted occupational therapy principles. This view is echoed by Komatsu et al. (<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) who espoused that &#x02018;although the independent self has traditionally been a major cornerstone of Western civilization &#x02026;, rewriting this culturally&#x02010;derived concept of self might now be necessary to move towards greater environmental sustainability&#x02019; (p1). Even if a professional focus shifts from person&#x02010;centredness to collective client&#x02010;centredness was to occur, this human&#x02010;centric focus still needs to be balanced with caring for the environment as an environmental determinant of health (Hess &#x00026; Rihtman,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>).</p><p>Professional governing bodies have shown growing recognition of the inclusion of environmental sustainability within occupational therapy education (e.g. RCOT,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). More contextualised education about how to practise environmental sustainability in occupational therapy is needed beyond linking with sustainable development goals (Seville et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>; Wagman et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0034" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Students are the practitioners and advocates of the profession of the future. It is imperative that occupational therapy students are prepared to meet the growing ethical challenges posed by climate change (Hess &#x00026; Rihtman,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>); however, students' perspectives about environmental sustainability in their education are currently unknown. Moreover, student occupational therapists' personal views and experience of the climate emergency affect their development of critical self&#x02010;awareness and degree of sustainability inclusion in their practice, and thus warrants interrogation (Taylor,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0032" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).</p><p>This study had three aims:<list list-type="bullet" id="aot12998-list-0002"><list-item id="aot12998-li-0004"><p>To explore occupational therapy students' attitudes, perceptions, and self&#x02010;perceived preparedness towards the challenge of delivering environmentally sustainable person&#x02010;centred care.</p></list-item><list-item id="aot12998-li-0005"><p>To investigate occupational therapy students' perceptions of the balance between meeting responsibilities for person&#x02010;centred care and environmentally sustainable wellbeing.</p></list-item><list-item id="aot12998-li-0006"><p>To explore students' self&#x02010;perceived preparedness and educational needs to meet the potential challenge of achieving balance between the two so that they can fulfil their professional advocacy obligations.</p></list-item></list>

From an environmental sustainability perspective, occupational therapy students are the practitioners of an uncertain future. This study aimed to explore occupational therapy students' attitudes to, perceptions of, and self&#x02010;perceived preparedness for delivering environmentally sustainable person&#x02010;centred care and advocacy and activism related to this approach to practise.</p><p>The key study findings highlighted a high level of awareness of the inequitable, disproportionate intergenerational injustice (Drolet et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) caused by climate change. Students appear to be willing to take personal actions and to advocate for changes to service provision to some degree. However, findings suggested that as specific actions led to a perceived increase of impacts on person&#x02010;centred care, support for pro&#x02010;environmental sustainability measures decreased (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This misalignment between ideal and actual actions may be explained by incongruence between participants' espouse theory (theories individuals claim to follow) and their theory in use (theories that are inferred by actions taken) (Argyris et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>). The ambiguity of how to extend one's willingness to act from the personal to the professional arena, with minimal impact on client care, represents a challenging dichotomy &#x02014; and professional dilemma &#x02014; between caring for persons and caring for the environment. The optimisation of how person, environment, and occupation interact is fundamental to occupational therapy (WFOT,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0036" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>); occupational therapists of the future need to develop skills that allow them to simultaneously deliver person&#x02010;centred care, while ensuring that it is not environmentally detrimental and does not lead to occupational injustice. Findings from this study have led to the proposal of three pedagogical actions and foci that may help with closing the congruence gap between intention and action for future practitioners' professional reasoning and clinical practice, namely <italic toggle="yes">specific knowledge and strategy learning, development of explicit advocacy Skills</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">development of explicit activism skills</italic>.</p><sec id="aot12998-sec-0029"><label>4.1</label><title>Environmental sustainable specific knowledge and strategy learning</title><p>Seville et al. (<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0028" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>) highlighted the importance of contextualising education for sustainable practice in occupational therapy. In this study, participants suggested learning content related to personal and professional actions, including advocacy, that they felt would enhance environmental sustainability in occupational therapy practice (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Closer examination of the responses revealed that participants want support with strategies to evaluate sustainability gain versus impact on service&#x02010;users. The desired critical evaluative skills above is an example of &#x02018;head&#x02019; skills from the 3H model. The 3H model of holistic education claims that &#x02018;teaching should be a unity of the head, heart and hands, that is, a unity of the cognitive, affective and psychomotor domains of learning&#x02019; (&#x0017d;i&#x0017e;anovi&#x00107;,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>, p.71). Participant suggestions represent predominantly &#x02018;head&#x02019; and &#x02018;hand&#x02019; skills within this model, and are addressed by some of the suggestions offered in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>.</p><p>It is, however, the authors' contention that providing strategies for the remaining &#x02018;heart&#x02019; element has the potential to reduce the gap between &#x02018;espouse theory&#x02019; and &#x02018;theory in action&#x02019; (Argyris et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>) for occupational therapy environmental sustainability education and practice. Critical consideration of the centrality of the individual in occupational therapy practice models may lead to culturally&#x02010;derived concepts of self&#x02010;moderation, which may help close the gap towards greater environmental sustainability. This move away from individual&#x02010;centric views is critical as higher ecological footprints, related to higher engagement in unsustainable occupations, are evident in more individualistic countries (Hess &#x00026; Rihtman,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">2023</xref>; Komatsu et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0019" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).</p><p>Further tailoring of teaching strategies is worth considering in relation to findings regarding participant prioritisation of climate justice. The current study suggests that there were significant differences between those who prioritised climate justice as opposed to those who did not, with those who prioritised climate justice demonstrating a significantly higher desire to learn more about this issue as compared to those who did not. It is not surprising that those who see climate justice as important are more interested to learn about it. However, for those who did not appear to prioritise this, there nonetheless remains a responsibility for educational programmes to provide them with effective strategies to embed environmental sustainability within their future practice. This is due to the responsibility of educational programmes to develop practitioners capable of addressing occupational injustice (Drolet et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), combined with the fact that intergenerational climate&#x02010;based health impacts and occupational injustice are attributable to human activities (Sultana,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0030" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>).</p><p>It is also worth considering the finding in this study that friends and family emerged as significant people with the power to either encourage or hinder action. For students who may not prioritise climate justice, the additional inclusion of sharing more information coupled with the use of nature as a learning environment may influence this group positively towards taking action as &#x02018;love of nature&#x02019; was reported to be a major enabler for action (as seen in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). This strategy targets a precursor for environmental concerns and behaviours called &#x02018;nature connectedness&#x02019;. Krasny (<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) defined &#x02018;nature connectedness&#x02019; as a feeling of connection and belonging to the natural community. Contrastingly, for students who already prioritise climate justice, addressing their learning needs appears to centre around the provision of greater practical support for both individual lifestyle and collective environmental actions (ranging from the personal level of occupation of what one eats or wears, how they spend money, or where they live, to seeking local activism and advocacy opportunities) (Krasny,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="aot12998-sec-0030"><label>4.2</label><title>Explicit advocacy and activism skills as a bridge for enhanced professional action</title><p>Critical reflection reveals that some content suggestions from participants (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) would require the capacity to flexibly combine head, hand, and heart skills in action (&#x0017d;i&#x0017e;anovi&#x00107;,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Notably, the categories of &#x02018;how to advocate, influence and get involved&#x02019; and &#x02018;how to be a sustainable allied health professional at work&#x02019; represent a continuum of development from self&#x02010;awareness through reflection, to understanding and being capable of influencing workplaces, to taking action for climate justice (referred to as &#x02018;sustainable competency&#x02019; in WFOT,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0037" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). This development could also be seen as an explicit example of the development of occupational therapists as advocates and activists (Pollard &#x00026; Sakellariou,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Eva Lewis, a young US advocate, suggested a simple comparison of the two interrelated yet distinctively different roles: &#x02018;To be an activist is to speak. To be an advocate is to listen&#x02019; (Soken&#x02010;Huberty,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0029" ref-type="bibr">n.d.</xref>). Using principles of skill acquisition from novice to expert (Rouse &#x00026; Dreyfus,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>) and the 3H model of holistic education (&#x0017d;i&#x0017e;anovi&#x00107;,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0039" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), recommendations for teaching advocacy and activist skills are described below. It is indeed important that &#x02014; on the personal level &#x02014; occupational therapists refrain from enforcing their individual beliefs on others. However, there remains a responsibility for occupational therapy educational programmes to impart up&#x02010;to&#x02010;date knowledge and skills about the health and wellbeing impacts of climate change and environmental sustainability, responsibilities for professional advocacy (Kirsh,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), and professional discussions regarding the political nature of the occupational therapy profession (Pollard &#x00026; Sakellariou,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Moreover, as the concept of environment is so central to the occupational therapy professional domain (American Occupational Therapy Association,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) (most occupational therapists would recognise claims about the foundational contribution of the person/environment/occupation paradigm), it could be argued that the occupational therapy profession has a unique responsibility for leading change in this area.</p><sec id="aot12998-sec-0031"><label>4.2.1</label><title>Development of explicit advocacy skills</title><p>Advocacy in occupational therapy involves taking actions that allow change to occur so that clients are able to engage in occupations that meet their needs, human rights, and enhance quality of life (Dhillon et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Occupational therapists use advocacy both for themselves (for personal fulfilment and influence) and for their clients (to ensure meeting of needs and human rights in the context of wellbeing and person&#x02010;centredness) (Dhillon et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The learning journey of advocacy begins with valuing it as a fundamental responsibility of occupational therapy professionals. It requires learning how to listen, make arguments based on data, articulate complexity, and work within systems (Arminio et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>; Dhillon et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The developmental stages of environmental sustainability advocacy skills for occupational therapy practice start with critical self&#x02010;awareness of power, privilege, and disadvantage. This is followed by gaining skills in analysing policies as preparation for considering occupational in/justice with service users. Finally, learners need to become able to respond to intergenerational impacts of climate injustice on health and participation (Drolet et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0009" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) through visible action. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref> illustrates these developmental stages, with examples of key concepts to embed at different stages across the occupational therapy curriculum.</p><fig position="float" fig-type="FIGURE" id="aot12998-fig-0004"><label>FIGURE 4</label><caption><p>Skill development strategies for occupational therapy sustainability advocacy.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AOT-72-0-g003" position="anchor" id="jats-graphic-7"/></fig><p>Personal experiences were identified from the current study as a contributor to self&#x02010;perceived preparedness for environmental sustainability advocacy. Practical learning activities to develop skills for communicating with peers, friends, and family are suggested as key teaching and learning exercises, since these individuals were found to have pivotal influence for learners in relation to environmental sustainability advocacy and action. The practical activity to learn communication skills noted above should be supplemented with factual knowledge related to the health implications of climate change and unequal occupational outcomes. In addition, the creation of safe spaces to share personal experiences between students and staff should be encouraged since doing so is essential to learning about advocacy (Arminio et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). While students can share their experiences of how climate change may have impacted them or strategies they have used (self&#x02010;advocacy), staff members can share their experiences of how to manage potential conflicts and use of &#x02018;underground practice&#x02019; as advocates (Dhillon et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In so doing, participatory citizenship in occupational therapy education can be initiated through all parties starting to share experience and power (Kiepek et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">2022</xref>). In turn, this should promote a sense of psychological safety and equity as students experience the potential consequences of advocacy and activism first hand.</p></sec><sec id="aot12998-sec-0032"><label>4.2.2</label><title>Development of explicit activism skills</title><p>Activism is &#x02018;the use of direct and noticeable action beyond [that which is] conventional or routine&#x02019; (Hart et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>: p1). Justice as a core occupational therapy value is translated into practice when occupational therapists act as activists (Bailliard et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Kirsh,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Pollard &#x00026; Sakellariou,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Kirsh (<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) argued that the occupational therapy profession must become more socially and politically responsible for the goal of enabling meaningful occupation for all. Kirsh (<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) highlighted equality and occupational justice as a global professional challenge in a general sense. However, her call for action is applicable to environmental sustainability in occupational therapy as it takes on the widest possible meaning of social and political context across space and time. The development of an activist identity requires education, combined with developing awareness that leads to moral discomfort (Hart et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). Activists can be sustained through development of resilience to resistance and commitment for action. According to Hart et al. (<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0013" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>), students are more likely to challenge the status quo as activists. Therefore, a combination of experiential learning combined with guided enquiry as well as skills for the development of resilience, is suggested as a way for students to learn about activism in a supported and manageable manner (Pollard &#x00026; Sakellariou,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="aot12998-sec-0033"><label>4.3</label><title>Limitations</title><p>The current lack of evidence surrounding environmental sustainability in occupational therapy means that high&#x02010;quality, up&#x02010;to&#x02010;date research is vital for promoting action. Within this, student voices are powerful in helping develop effective university education, but due to the inequitable global impacts of climate change, more cross&#x02010;cultural research is needed. In the current study, the student demographic was limited to UK&#x02010;based universities which potentially presented a Western bias. Additionally, the sampling methods may have attracted students with existing interest in or concern for the topic to participate, thereby presenting a bias in results.</p><p>A further limitation lies in the fact that the surveys upon which this study was based were not developed or validated specifically for occupational therapy students; studies which employ questionnaires that are not validated for the target population may be subject to measurement error (Dowrick et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). However, the published instruments that were selected for this study provided a suitable foundation due to their relevance to health&#x02010;care practitioners, while the descriptive questions developed for the purposes of this study helped to increase the relevance and applicability of the survey to occupational therapy students. Although conclusions drawn from studies that use adapted or non&#x02010;validated questionnaires may not be made with certainty (Dowrick et al.,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0008" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), the use of instruments selected for their broad relevance can be viewed as appropriate for exploratory research, which may be viewed as either a problem that has not been researched before, or the exploration of an existing problem to identify new ideas which cannot yet be verified (Swedberg,&#x000a0;<xref rid="aot12998-bib-0031" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).</p><p>The urgency of the climate crisis means that it is imperative health professionals continue engaging in research in this topic, to be transformed into knowledge for action and tangible change.

As the next generation of occupational therapists, students are a key demographic through which better understanding of current attitudes and perceptions with the intention of tackling this crisis can be developed. A student&#x02010;centric research approach has the potential to support knowledge translation for those people most likely to become active agents of change for the climate crisis that is imperative within the health&#x02010;care sector. Findings from this study reinforce the importance for formal occupational therapy education programmes to support students to translate their evident concern for climate change and willingness for action into knowledge, strategies, and action. For this to be achieved, occupational therapy practitioners and educators are encouraged to engage in continuing professional development opportunities to develop specific knowledge and strategies, and to reflect on where and how their skills in advocacy can be applied to environmental sustainability in occupational therapy. Equally, students must develop skills for tackling the potentially ethical dilemma, and apparent dichotomy, between meeting professional responsibilities for person&#x02010;centred care while promoting justice and equity within planetary boundaries.</p></sec><sec id="aot12998-sec-0038"><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>Felicity Murray was a pre&#x02010;registration MSc occupational therapy student at the time of the study.
