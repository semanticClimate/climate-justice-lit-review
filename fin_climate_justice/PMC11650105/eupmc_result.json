Environmental sustainability is directly linked with the health and wellbeing of current and future generations, presenting occupational therapists with a unique advocacy and activist role. As practitioners of the future, there is an urgent need to understand students' attitudes, perceptions of, and self-perceived preparedness for, dealing with environmental determinants of health and intergenerational occupational and climate justice.<h4>Methods</h4>A cross-sectional exploratory descriptive survey collected United Kingdom (UK) based allied health professional students' attitudes, perceptions, and self-perceived preparedness for advocating for environmental sustainability in the context of person-centred care. The survey was distributed to 48 gatekeepers in UK institutions with approved allied health professional training programmes (44 offered occupational therapy); 62 occupational therapy students responded. Descriptive and non-parametric inferential statistics were used to analyse quantitative data. Text and short answers were analysed qualitatively via inductive content analysis.<h4>Consumer and community involvement</h4>The study was co-designed and implemented with MSc (pre-registration) occupational therapy students.<h4>Results</h4>Participants (94%) expressed concerns for climate change, with 84% feeling responsible for addressing environmental sustainability in health care. While 64.5% identified climate justice as a top priority, a perceived challenge emerged between person-centred care and sustainability, with only 18% of participants feeling prepared for environmental sustainability in occupational therapy practice. Participants requested education on personal and professional sustainability practices, as well as collective action. Sharing personal climate change experiences, advocating with family and friends, and facilitating connections for collective action were highlighted as potentially transformative educational tools in this area.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Occupational therapy curricula should address environmental sustainability through pragmatic, critical, and ethical lenses to enhance students' preparedness for this advocacy and activist role. Reflection and continuous professional development for environmentally sustainable practices is recommended.<h4>Plain language summary</h4>Occupational therapists believe that it is important to support people to participate in occupations that matter to them. However, the activities that some people choose to participate in may have negative effects on the environment and the planet. It is important to ensure that when occupational therapists support people in their choices of activities, this does not lead to unequal access to healthy and meaningful occupations of others, now or in the future. That is because occupational therapists also have a responsibility to prevent occupational injustice. Occupational therapy students are the professionals of the future, so it is important to include them in research about this topic. They need to develop skills that allow them to simultaneously make sure that they are delivering person-centred care, which is not environmentally detrimental and that does not lead to occupational injustice. Making sure that occupational therapists provide person-centred care while also managing risks of occupational injustice may be seen as a profession-specific dilemma. In this study, occupational therapy students in the UK completed a survey about their feelings, views, and readiness for managing this dilemma. Results showed that most respondents are concerned about climate change, but do not feel that their occupational therapy education sufficiently prepared them to practise in an environmentally sustainable way. They were asked to propose ideas for addressing this issue, and the article discusses how occupational therapy curricula might be changed in accordance.", "affiliation": "Occupational Therapy Programme, Department of Sport, Nutrition and Allied Health Professions, Oxford Brookes University, Oxford, UK.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print-Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "grantsList": {"grant": [{"agency": "Biomedical Research Centre", "orderIn": "0"}, {"agency": "Health Research", "orderIn": "0"}, {"agency": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust/Institute of Cancer Research", "orderIn": "0"}, {"agency": "Department of Health, Australian Government", "orderIn": "0"}, {"agency": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)", "acronym": "DH_", "orderIn": "0"}]}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Humans"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Occupational Therapy", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "ED", "qualifierName": "education", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Cross-Sectional Studies"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Attitude of Health Personnel"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Students, Health Occupations", "meshQualifierList": {"meshQualifier": {"abbreviation": "PX", "qualifierName": "psychology", "majorTopic_YN": "N"}}}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Adult"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Patient-Centered Care"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Female"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Male"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Young Adult"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Climate Change"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "United Kingdom"}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Ethics", "Education", "Occupational Therapy", "Advocacy", "Environmental Sustainability", "Climate Justice", "Person\u2010centred Care"]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/1440-1630.12998"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC11650105"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC11650105?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "1", "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "N", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2024-12-17", "dateOfCreation": "2024-10-15", "firstIndexDate": "2024-10-16", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2024-12-23", "dateOfRevision": "2025-01-04", "electronicPublicationDate": "2024-10-15", "firstPublicationDate": "2024-10-15"}
