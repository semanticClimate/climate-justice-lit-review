Relationship building is essential to successful youth participation in health policy and climate change as it creates intergenerational learning and cross-cultural engagement. At the same time, both sets of youth also deal with compounding challenges due to contemporary and historical legacies of colonialism and inequality. Yet, tokenism challenges the participatory process as adults profess to value youth perspectives, yet recommendations by youth often do not get incorporated into policies or plans. For organizations and agencies trying to build youth's capacity, organizations and agencies should look to programs that train youth in advocacy. These programs help build youth's confidence, increase their optimism for change, and give youth a sense of ownership.", "affiliation": "Georgia Institute of Technology, School of City and Regional Planning, Atlanta, GA, USA.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print-Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["article-commentary", "Journal Article"]}, "meshHeadingList": {"meshHeading": [{"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Humans"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Learning"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Social Justice"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "Y", "descriptorName": "Health Policy"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Adolescent"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "Adult"}, {"majorTopic_YN": "N", "descriptorName": "South Africa"}]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Climate change", "Health Policy", "Youth Participation", "Youth Advocacy"]}, "subsetList": {"subset": {"code": "IM", "name": "Index Medicus"}}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.34172/ijhpm.2023.7898"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC10843366"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC10843366?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "1", "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "N", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCompletion": "2024-04-16", "dateOfCreation": "2024-04-15", "firstIndexDate": "2024-04-16", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2024-02-07", "dateOfRevision": "2025-07-10", "electronicPublicationDate": "2023-11-20", "firstPublicationDate": "2023-11-20"}
