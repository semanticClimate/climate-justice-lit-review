We developed a web-based, geospatial tool called Future Shorelines that integrates high-resolution landscape elevation data and a matrix of locally derived NOAA Interagency Sea Level Rise Scenarios to characterize future conditions of submergence and shoreline translation induced by sea level rise. Once the practitioner selects a location of interest, sea level rise scenario (e.g., high), and target year (e.g., 2050), the tool will generate plan view and cross-sectional informational graphics specific to their choices. This information can then be paired with other menu options, like parcel ownership, to facilitate the planning and construction of nature-based shoreline stabilization solutions that (1) are located where opportunities for horizontal migration are optimized, (2) remain accessible for monitoring and maintenance, and (3) perform as intended over the design life of the installation. The tool's menu options and the user interface were informed by project partner input solicited during numerous workshops convened over the duration of the 2-year project. This coproduction created a product that was familiar to the end user and therefore increased the likelihood that it would be utilized by them during the planning and design of living shoreline projects. Although developed for use in the Indian River Lagoon, located along the east-central Florida coast, it can be seamlessly replicated for application in other coastal regions of the USA where the requisite data are available.", "affiliation": "Institute of Environment, Florida International University, Miami, FL 33199 USA.", "publicationStatus": "ppublish", "language": "eng", "pubModel": "Print-Electronic", "pubTypeList": {"pubType": ["research-article", "Journal Article"]}, "keywordList": {"keyword": ["Climate change", "Sea level rise", "Florida", "Environmental Justice", "Indian River Lagoon", "Living Shorelines", "Nature-based Solutions", "Coastal Resiliency"]}, "fullTextUrlList": {"fullTextUrl": [{"availability": "Subscription required", "availabilityCode": "S", "documentStyle": "doi", "site": "DOI", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s12237-024-01425-9"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "html", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC11488480"}, {"availability": "Open access", "availabilityCode": "OA", "documentStyle": "pdf", "site": "Europe_PMC", "url": "https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC11488480?pdf=render"}]}, "isOpenAccess": "Y", "inEPMC": "Y", "inPMC": "Y", "hasPDF": "Y", "hasBook": "N", "hasSuppl": "N", "citedByCount": "0", "hasData": "N", "hasReferences": "Y", "hasTextMinedTerms": "Y", "hasDbCrossReferences": "N", "hasLabsLinks": "N", "license": "cc by", "hasEvaluations": "N", "authMan": "N", "epmcAuthMan": "N", "nihAuthMan": "N", "hasTMAccessionNumbers": "N", "dateOfCreation": "2024-10-21", "firstIndexDate": "2024-10-22", "fullTextReceivedDate": "2024-10-31", "dateOfRevision": "2024-10-23", "electronicPublicationDate": "2024-09-04", "firstPublicationDate": "2024-09-04"}
