In Buffalo, New York, where thousands of lives and billions of dollars in future urban developments are at stake, an unbiased approach to evaluating crumbling transportation infrastructures has become an urgent and critical need. In particular, the Kensington Expressway - Route 33 (hereinafter referred to as &#x0201c;Expressway&#x0201d;) is at an advanced age; it was initially constructed as an urban renewal and racism-by-design highway that gutted the East Side of Buffalo in the 1960s. The East Side, an area that is home to over 80% of all Black Buffalonians, was once graced with the Humboldt Parkway. Landscaped by Frederick Law Olmsted, who proclaimed Buffalo to be &#x0201c;the best planned city, as to streets, public places, and grounds, in the United States, if not in the world,&#x0201d; Humboldt Parkway was an idyllic greenscape and oasis for recreation, fellowship, and active living that was demolished and replaced by the Expressway (<xref rid="f1-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="fig">Figure A</xref>) (<xref rid="s1-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 1, 2</xref>) (<xref rid="b12-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="bibr">Kowsky &#x00026; Carr, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Now, the Expressway is a constant source of noise and air pollution. These environmental hazards are deleterious to human health and wellbeing and are an on-going detriment to sustainability and efforts to combat the climate crisis. Specifically, fine particulate matter (PM2.5), a modulator and contributor of the climate crisis, is 26% to 28% above average on the East Side compared to the entire Buffalo and Niagara region (<xref rid="b25-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="b4-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="b20-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="bibr">NYSDEC, 2024</xref>; <xref rid="b13-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="bibr">McAndrew, 2024</xref>; <xref rid="b28-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="bibr">Shuman, 2024</xref>). Vehicular emissions, including PM2.5, have contributed to disparately high rates of chronic diseases and illnesses, such as asthma, heart disease, cancers, mental disorders, and even a five to ten year shorter life expectancy among Black vs. White Buffalo residents (<xref rid="b37-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="bibr">Yoo &#x00026; Roberts, 2024</xref>; <xref rid="b15-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="bibr">Murphy et al., 2022</xref>). The University at Buffalo (UB) Department of Architecture Small Built Works class documented these conditions specifically to Humboldt Parkway neighborhoods using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Environmental Justice Screen Tool (<xref rid="s1-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 3&#x02013;5 and 9</xref>). Furthermore, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) just released the Community Air Quality Initiative conducted in 2021&#x02013;2022. This report revealed that levels of PM2.5 are highest in Buffalo and &#x0201c;Above Focus Spot Threshold&#x0201d; especially in Hamlin Park and Trinidad, neighborhoods that straddle the Expressway and Scajaquada Expressway - Route 198 (<xref rid="s1-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 6</xref>) (<xref rid="b13-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="bibr">McAndrew, 2024</xref>). Just last year, the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) released the Expressway Draft Design Report/Environmental Assessment (DDR/EA) and in Appendix D7 projected vehicle exhaust plumes were depicted spewing 900-feet out each portal end (<xref rid="s1-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 7</xref>). The UB Small Built Works class overlaid these NYSDOT&#x02019;s projected plumes back onto the neighborhoods with pin-mapped locations of schools, churches, medical, and youth facilities (<xref rid="s1-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>These stakes and costs, namely the health of East Side communities, are too high to default to a one-size-fits-all approach for highway remediation. Based on these unique set of circumstances in Buffalo, we developed a five tier Transportation Infrastructure Evaluation System (TIES), an objective set of criteria for the remediation and/or maintenance of any given transportation corridor, especially urban highways. &#x0201c;Tier One &#x02013; Complete Highway Removal&#x0201d; describes what is needed in Buffalo for basic health, and environmental, social, and transportation justice. Building on what we have learned in our own advocacy, this paper presents TIES, which could contribute to a nationwide discussion for setting highway maintenance and evaluation criteria. Additionally, TIES could move the needle towards a standardization of criteria that will be essential for all impending human health and global sustainability issues in the upcoming decades. These intersecting points of concern, although magnifying, are not new. But, in order to fully understand the breadth and depth of said issues, it is necessary to take a step back and review how we got to this point.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other"><title>U.S. Interstate Highway System</title><p>The idea of a U.S. transcontinental highway system originated in the summer of 1919, after Lieutenant Dwight D. Eisenhower participated in the country&#x02019;s first motor convoy, from Washington, D.C., to San Francisco, California. The young Lieutenant reported some difficulties with the various types of vehicles, like &#x0201c;chain drive trucks,&#x0201d; and explicitly detailed in his November 3, 1919 memorandum the road challenges he encountered throughout the trip.</p><disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;It was further observed that some of the good roads are too narrow.

Eisenhower, November 3, 1919</attrib></disp-quote><p>As a result of inadequate roads and highways, the excursion took over two months to complete, but planted the seed of Eisenhower&#x02019;s eventual quest for road development and improvement throughout the country. Approximately, 25 years later, Eisenhower was stationed in Germany during World War II where he became enamored by the Reichsautobahnen, a network of freeways with construction initiated under Adolph Hitler&#x02019;s authority as Chancellor of the Third Reich in 1933. Eisenhower&#x02019;s vision for a U.S. transcontinental highway system was now resolute, and when he became president, he was determined to make it an actuality. At this point, the U.S. Federal Aid Highway Act of 1944 had already authorized the unfunded construction of a 41,000-mile network of highways throughout the nation, but without federal aid this would be a nearly impossible endeavor for state and local governments. However, three years after becoming the president, Eisenhower signed the U.S. Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956. Congress approved a strategy for funding roughly $26 billion. With this strategy, the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways would be supported and financed with an increased gasoline tax. Eisenhower&#x02019;s original intent of the Interstate and Defense Highways was to not only facilitate travel <italic toggle="yes">between</italic> cities, but to also serve as a defense strategy &#x0201c;in case of [an] atomic attack on our key cities, the road net [would] permit quick evacuation of target areas&#x0201d; (<xref rid="b31-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="bibr">U.S.C., 1956</xref>). However, throughout the country, these structures were also being built <italic toggle="yes">within</italic> cities and soon served as physical edifices to perpetuate environmental racism by way of urban renewal, White Flight, residential segregation, and the bifurcation of non-White communities (<xref rid="b26-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="bibr">Reft et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Approaching 70 years in age, the Interstate and Defense Highway System is deteriorating, and in such an advanced state of decay that immediate attention is required in many American cities. For example, in Buffalo, the NYSDOT is so far behind in the maintenance of the Expressway that the massive reinforced concrete retaining walls &#x0201c;have been deteriorating at a rapid rate over the past 5 to 10 years&#x0201d; and are to the point where they cannot be repaired, and must be back-supported by soldier piles, entirely removed, and replaced. Also, &#x0201c;all five of the bridges have&#x02026;exceeded their expected 40-year service life&#x0201d; by as much as 20-years (<xref rid="s1-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 12</xref>) (<xref rid="b22-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="bibr">NYSDOT, 2023a</xref>). The nation&#x02019;s miles of endless roads for transporting millions of vehicles, often carrying only a single occupant, are also, in many instances becoming obsolete, superfluous and inconsequential. While there are municipalities where the yearly average highway traffic exceeds 100,000 daily vehicles, such as Los Angeles, CA (190,285/day), Miami, FL (122,509/day) and Atlanta, GA (113,440/day), other post-industrial regions, particularly cities in New York State, like Buffalo (31,361/day),<xref rid="fn1-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="fn">1</xref> Syracuse (28,085/day), and Rochester (39,226/day), do not even reach an average level of 50,000 highway vehicles daily (<xref rid="b33-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="bibr">USDOT, 2021</xref>). This begs the question&#x02026;<italic toggle="yes">are these 1950s cold war era, aging, inter- and intra- state highways even necessary?</italic> A decision-making process for determining the repair, replacement, or removal of these infrastructures is fully warranted as these highways continue to crumble and reach the end of their anticipated service life. And just as importantly, actions of reparation and atonement are imperative for any level of reconnection in Buffalo and other cities throughout the country that targeted and devasted communities of color with the placement and construction of neighborhood intrastate highways.</p></sec><sec sec-type="other"><title>White Men&#x02019;s Roads Through Black Men&#x02019;s Homes</title><p>The slogan &#x0201c;White Men&#x02019;s Roads Through Black Men&#x02019;s Homes&#x0201d; encapsulated the opposition of a planned highway, the North Central Freeway, in Washington, D.C (<xref rid="s1-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 10</xref>). In 1967, Sammie Abbott of the Emergency Committee for the Transportation Crisis, stated these words in a testimony before the National Capital Planning Commission. However, Reginald Booker, a young construction worker, anti-freeway activist and social justice leader, leveraged the mantra to galvanize protests against highway construction in Washington, D.C.&#x02019;s Black neighborhoods. As a child who had been displaced and forced to move, along with 23,000 other residents, due to an urban renewal project, Booker understood the dynamics of race(ism) with regard to urban design and planning.</p><disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;The whole freeway situation was predicated on race, economics and militarism&#x02026; race because the freeway was designed to come through the Black community&#x02026; economics because it was designed politically and economically to destroy Black communities, especially Black home owners, where most Black people invest most of their money into buying a home.&#x0201d;</italic> (<xref rid="b29-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="bibr">Simpson, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="b2-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="bibr">Borchardt. 2013</xref>)</p><attrib>Reginald Booker, January 25, 1967</attrib></disp-quote><p>Like so many other cities in the U.S., highway expansion from the late 1950s and through the early 1970s, &#x0201c;darkened and disrupted the pedestrian landscape, worsened air quality and torpedoed property values,&#x0201d; and obliterated neighborhoods with the loss of green space, churches, homes, and businesses (<xref rid="b7-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="bibr">Evans, 2021</xref>). USDOT estimates that more than 475,000 households and more than a million people were displaced throughout the country because of these highway expansions. Impacted communities, who were predominately Black and often poor, were especially devasted by the loss of small businesses because they provided employment and maintained a local circulation of money. Local commerce was a vital necessity for these communities, who were already weakened by racist zoning policies, disinvestment, and White flight. By design, policymakers and planners used highway construction as a strategy &#x0201c;to raze neighborhoods considered undesirable or blighted and they deployed massive infrastructure elements&#x02014;multi-lane roadbeds, concrete walls, ramps and overpasses&#x02014;as tools of segregation [and] physical buffers to isolate communities of color,&#x0201d; according to New York University law professor Deborah N. Archer (<xref rid="b7-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="bibr">Evans, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="b1-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="bibr">Archer, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Cities such as New York, Miami, Chicago, Minneapolis, Pittsburgh, Oakland, Nashville, Baltimore, Atlanta, and Buffalo were all harmed by these highway expansion plans (<xref rid="b5-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="bibr">Dottle et al., 2021</xref>). In Buffalo, the home of the nation&#x02019;s first fully connected citywide park and parkway system, the Buffalo Park System designed by the Father of Landscape Architecture (Frederick Law Olmsted) and Calvert Vaux, originally included three major parks and several picturesque parkways. However, as mentioned previously, Humboldt Parkway was destroyed by the intrusion of the six-lane Expressway. Today, Buffalo&#x02019;s East Side, where Humboldt Parkway once sat, has a significant green space deficit and the residents &#x0201c;have access to 54% less nearby park space than those living in White neighborhoods&#x0201d;(<xref rid="s1-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 11</xref>) (<xref rid="b30-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="bibr">TPL, 2024</xref>). Yet, East Side residents endure the brunt of asthma cases.

Article 78 Petitions have been filed by the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU), the Western New York Youth Climate Council (WNYYCC) and the East Side Parkways Coalition (ESP). ESP is a community advocacy organization formed by Candace Moppins and Brad Wales in the summer of 2023. ESP has also teamed-up with We Are Women Warriors (WAWW), led by former Buffalo Common Council Member and Erie County Legislator Betty Jean Grant and local activist Sherry Sherrill to host community information sessions and to canvas hundreds of homeowners in the immediate Humboldt Parkway neighborhoods and on the East Side. The WAWW/ESP canvasing events opened the door to meeting directly affected residents and discussing the potential effects, and the construction schedule of the proposed Tunnel. (<xref rid="s1-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 14&#x02013;17</xref>) These efforts eventually garnered 61 plaintiffs for the ESP lawsuit, many of whom live very close to the Expressway (<xref rid="s1-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 18</xref>).

Looking optimistically to the future, the current I-190 Expressway cuts off the City from the Lake Erie and Niagara River waterfronts, yet because it is essential for the efficient transportation needs of the metro region, the preferred alternative that would still provide waterfront access would be a Tier Two improvement (<xref rid="s1-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 22</xref>). This would be a tremendously impactful project to address in the not too distant future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The Interstate and Defense Highway System &#x0201c;fundamentally restructured urban America&#x0201d; and in many cities the results of this restructuring have been devastating (<xref rid="b7-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="bibr">Evans, 2021</xref>; <xref rid="b1-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="bibr">Archer, 2020</xref>). For Buffalo, in particular, there are numerous multi-generational tragedies, one of which was the destruction of Humboldt Parkway, a 2-mile-long, 188-foot-wide green space bordered by rows of Maple and Elm trees in the 1960s (<xref rid="s1-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Figure 23&#x02013;25</xref>) (<xref rid="b27-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="bibr">Roberts, 2023</xref>). Today&#x02019;s stories, recounted at ESP meetings and events, are of family members who lived along Humboldt Parkway and near the Expressway that are now suffering from asthma, a myriad of chronic conditions and increased mortality. Moreover, we can clearly see the pervasive decay of the built environments adjacent to the Expressway. There are houses blackened by vehicle exhaust and falling into disrepair, cultural and commercial districts that have been virtually erased, and vacant churches with overlooked historic and architectural significance. Now that the initial construction projects of the Interstate and Defense Highway System are reaching the end of their service life, it is time to re-evaluate the core functionality of the system. If President Eisenhower never intended the highways to go <italic toggle="yes">through cities</italic>, and these highways are well-documented to have caused so much harm, then why should it be assumed we need to rebuild them? As a nation, with so much government funding on the table, are we going to double-down on the mistakes of the past, or are we going to &#x0201c;right the wrongs of the past&#x0201d;? Ironically, these are the words New York State Governor Kathy Hochul and NYSDOT have used to promote the proposed $1 billion &#x000be;-mile tunnel, which in reality, would cement in-place the Expressway and continue to perpetuate the existing environmental racism (<xref rid="b10-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="bibr">Hochul, 2023</xref>; <xref rid="b36-jheal-4-2-47" ref-type="bibr">WGRZ, 2024</xref>). The climate crisis is happening, but NYSDOT continues to prioritize car-centric transportation infrastructure, one of the largest contributors of greenhouse gasses. Ultimately, this is why we are suggesting TIES as a tool to prioritize health and achieve environmental, social, and transportation justice. TIES is offered for Buffalo&#x02019;s East Side residents and the countless number of communities throughout the nation that have been marginalized by historic and current day transit injustices. There is still hope because the conclusion to Buffalo&#x02019;s story has not yet been written. There is still time to speak truth to power in Buffalo and more inclusively &#x0201c;reconnect the community.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><supplementary-material id="s1-jheal-4-2-47" position="float" content-type="local-data"><media xlink:href="JHEAL-4-2-47S.pdf" id="d67e363" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1-jheal-4-2-47"><label>1</label><p>NYSDOT reports 75,000 vehicles per day in the Final Design Report/Environmental Assessment (FDR/EA) of January 2024, page 11.
