<bold>Background:</bold> When nurses feel that the learning processes in their organization are fair and just, they are more likely to feel confident about sharing their knowledge, expressing their concerns, and contributing to the learning process. Conversely, suppose employees perceive a lack of organizational justice. In that case, they may be less likely to speak up and share their valuable input due to concerns about unfair treatment or possible negative consequences.</p><p>
<bold>Objective:</bold> Nurses' silence and organizational learning may have a connection yet to be thoroughly investigated. We are exploring whether organizational justice mediates this relationship by improving nurses' perception of it and reducing silence among them.</p><p>
<bold>Methods:</bold> A study was conducted in Ardabil, Iran, to analyze the correlation between organizational learning, organizational justice, and organizational silence among 319 healthcare professionals from five hospitals. The study utilized three assessment tools: the organizational learning questionnaire, the organizational justice scale, and the organizational silence scale. The collected data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics, and a structural equation model (SEM) was developed using the bootstrap method in AMOS 24.0 to test the proposed model.</p><p>
<bold>Results:</bold> Our study found a strong positive relationship between organizational learning and organizational justice and a significant negative correlation between organizational learning and silence. Also, there was a significant negative relationship between organizational justice and silence. SEM showed that organizational learning indirectly affects organizational silence through organizational justice as a mediator, explaining 72.3% of all variance in organizational silence.</p><p>
<bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our findings indicated that organizational learning is positively associated with justice but negatively associated with silence. When nurses experience organizational justice, they are less likely to remain silent. Encouraging nurses to share their opinions and concerns reduces silence and improves working conditions, morale, and patient care. Further research is needed to understand the complex interplay between organizational learning, justice, and silence in nursing settings.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="Inspec"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>clinical nurses</kwd><kwd>Iran</kwd><kwd>organizational justice</kwd><kwd>organizational learning</kwd><kwd>organizational silence</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>In today's rapidly evolving healthcare landscape, organizations must prioritize innovation and improvement to enhance patient safety and quality of care. Nurses are crucial in driving change and fostering innovation, directly impacting healthcare outcomes [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Their contributions are invaluable and warrant our utmost respect and appreciation. However, healthcare organizations face significant challenges in delivering safe, high-quality care amid constant change and uncertainty [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In this context, experts in healthcare management advocate for organizational learning as a promising strategy to address these challenges and improve safety and quality, offering a beacon of hope in the face of these difficulties [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Organizational learning involves creating, acquiring, and integrating knowledge to develop resources and competencies that enhance organizational performance [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. It encompasses implementing strategies and executive plans to improve services through knowledge and better understanding, empowering employees to continually utilize their abilities to identify and comprehend complexities, clarify goals, and develop [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Understanding the cognitive and social aspects of learning is crucial for effective knowledge-sharing and organizational changes in healthcare. Integrating learning into daily operations at all levels is vital for organizational success [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Continuous learning is essential for nurses' professional development and is a source of motivation. Participation in ongoing learning initiatives helps nurses adapt to rapid changes in knowledge, nursing practices, and healthcare delivery [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In a dynamic healthcare environment, healthcare workers must be well-prepared and empowered to voice their opinions, enabling adaptation and continuous improvement [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Learning from healthcare workers is beneficial and essential for organizations striving to outperform competitors and enhance safety and quality [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The current educational system in universities imparts students with a blend of knowledge and concepts. However, it should also equip them with the skills to analyze, prioritize, and organize new knowledge, necessitating critical thinking and practical learning. Therefore, it is crucial to focus on the organizational learning management of nurses [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>A significant barrier to effective organizational performance is &#x0201c;organizational silence,&#x0201d; defined as employees' conscious withholding of concerns and ideas about organizational issues [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Historically, silence was often equated with loyalty; however, recent studies reveal that a culture of silence can lead to detrimental outcomes within organizations, such as poor decision-making, reduced adaptability, and compromised patient safety and care quality [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Employees' reluctance to share honest feedback can hinder decision-making processes, limit organizational adaptability, and reduce the capacity for change, ultimately jeopardizing patient safety and care quality [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The inability to address negative feedback can stifle organizational development, reduce efficiency, and foster employee dissatisfaction, leading to stress and deviant behaviors [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, research indicates that organizational justice, which refers to the fairness and ethical treatment of individuals within an organization, is crucial in shaping employee attitudes and behaviors [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It significantly influences the reduction of organizational silence and helps explain employee reactions to perceived unfairness in processes and outcomes [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Fair treatment fosters a positive work environment, encouraging employees to speak up, while perceptions of injustice lead to silence [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The social exchange theory suggests that a fair organizational climate can mitigate silence, highlighting a negative correlation between organizational justice and employee silence [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The Iranian culture's emphasis on collectivism and respect for hierarchy significantly influences nurses' approach to learning in healthcare settings. Prioritizing family and community can create a collaborative environment that values knowledge sharing. However, cultural norms may lead to organizational silence if individuals hesitate to speak up. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for developing strategies that promote open communication and encourage organizational learning among Iranian nurses, ultimately improving patient care and safety. Despite the significance of these dynamics, further research is needed to understand the relationship between organizational learning and silence among nurses [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Specifically, it is essential to determine whether nurses' perceptions of organizational justice improve with organizational learning, leading to a reduction in silence. This study aims to address this gap by investigating the role of organizational justice in mediating the relationship between organizational learning and silence among nurses. By elucidating these connections, this research provides valuable insights into how healthcare organizations can foster a culture of transparency and continuous improvement, ultimately benefiting patient care and organizational effectiveness.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Literature Overview</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Organizational Learning and Nurses' Organizational Silence</title><p>Experts in healthcare management advocate for organizational learning as a vital strategy for enhancing safety and quality within healthcare settings [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Organizational learning is strategically positioned in modern management to enhance employees' skills and foster the organization's adaptability. The organization can effectively respond to market changes and maintain its competitive position by cultivating a dynamic learning environment [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Organizational learning, which is a process that fosters positive change in an organization's knowledge, cognition, and collective actions, ultimately improving its capacity to achieve desired outcomes [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], is particularly important in the face of rapid changes and unpredictability in the healthcare environment. It is crucial for healthcare workers to feel empowered to express their opinions and suggestions, as this open dialog is essential for adaptation and continuous improvement [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Healthcare workers who voice their concerns are critical in identifying and preventing avoidable patient harm and enhancing patient safety [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Organizational silence, which is the conscious choice of employees not to share their concerns and ideas, poses a significant risk in healthcare settings [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This silence often stems from fear or distrust, leading to withholding crucial information. This lack of communication can result in poor decision-making, jeopardizing patient safety and care quality. Therefore, fostering an open communication and transparency environment is imperative for mitigating the risks associated with organizational silence [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Organizational Justice and Nurses' Organizational Silence</title><p>Organizational justice pertains to perceptions of fairness within the workplace and encompasses various dimensions, including distributive justice (fairness of outcomes) and interactional justice (IJ) (fairness of interpersonal interactions) [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Research has demonstrated a strong correlation between perceptions of organizational justice and positive workplace outcomes, such as enhanced job performance, increased organizational commitment, and reduced turnover intentions [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Furthermore, distributive and IJ significantly contribute to employees' psychological well-being, fostering satisfaction and self-actualization [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In nursing, organizational justice is a potent predictor of attitudes and behaviors. Studies have revealed that diminished perceptions of organizational justice are linked with increased organizational silence among nurses [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This relationship underscores the importance of fair treatment in promoting a culture where nurses feel valued and respected, and thus, feel comfortable voicing their concerns. This, in turn, enhances patient safety and organizational effectiveness.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Nurses' Organizational Learning and Organizational Justice</title><p>In today's fiercely competitive healthcare landscape, the ability of organizations to learn faster than their rivals is a crucial survival factor [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Continuous learning enables employees to adapt to ongoing changes and enhances long-term performance by leveraging their skills and values [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, the ramifications of ineffective organizational learning, such as stagnation, poor performance, and declining quality, emphasize the importance of continuous learning. Therefore, it is essential to emphasize this aspect to make healthcare professionals feel more prepared and adaptable. Fostering fair and ethical behavior is crucial to establishing a strong foundation for this learning, as it significantly improves decision-making and creates an environment conducive to learning [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Organizational justice is pivotal in this context, as it directly influences how employees perceive their workplace and its learning culture [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. By promoting an atmosphere of fairness, organizations can enhance perceptions of justice among employees, thereby creating a culture that values shared experiences and knowledge [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. As leaders, it is our responsibility to ensure that our organizations are fair and just, fostering an environment where everyone feels valued and respected. The dimensions of organizational justice, procedural justice (PJ) and IJ, are particularly relevant, as they can significantly impact employees' willingness to engage in learning behaviors. This culture of equity encourages individuals to learn from their experiences and promotes open communication, reducing the likelihood of organizational silence [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Further research is necessary to explore the intricate relationship between organizational learning and organizational justice, mainly how the dimensions of justice influence learning processes. Incorporating current literature on this topic will also strengthen the foundation of this discussion, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of these critical dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>2.4. The Mediating Role of Organizational Justice</title><p>Organizational learning encompasses the processes organizations acquire, create, and transfer knowledge essential for adaptation and survival in a competitive landscape [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Conversely, organizational justice refers to the perceived fairness in workplace interactions, including distributive, PJ, and IJ [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Organizational silence, defined as withholding critical information and ideas, can severely impede organizational effectiveness [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Existing research on organizational learning, organizational justice, and organizational silence in healthcare has identified notable gaps. This study addresses these gaps by exploring the factors contributing to nurses' fear or distrust, which can lead to silence. While the impact of organizational justice on various outcomes is acknowledged, further investigation is needed into its effects on nursing practices and patient safety, particularly regarding how different dimensions of justice influence nurses' willingness to voice concerns. Our proposed mediation model suggests that employees are more likely to share knowledge and raise concerns when they perceive organizational learning processes as fair. Conducting additional studies will be essential in validating this model and providing insights into the interplay between organizational learning, justice, and silence in healthcare contexts.</p><sec id="sec2.4.1"><title>2.4.1. Research Hypotheses</title><p>This study examines the complex interconnections among organizational learning, organizational justice, and organizational silence within nursing.

<statement id="hyp1"><title>Hypothesis 1 .</title><p>Organizational learning is correlated with organizational silence.</p><p>Rationale: Learning organizations create an environment that encourages the expression of opinions and ideas, which can lead to a reduction in organizational silence. Research has shown that in learning environments, employees are more likely to share concerns and suggestions, ultimately improving care quality and patient safety [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p></statement>
</p><p>
<statement id="hyp2"><title>Hypothesis 2 .</title><p>Organizational justice is correlated with organizational silence.</p><p>Rationale: Perceptions of injustice in the workplace can lead to employee silence, as individuals may refrain from expressing their views. Studies indicate that distributive and IJ can significantly influence employees' willingness to voice concerns, suggesting that organizational justice can help mitigate silence [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p></statement>
</p><p>
<statement id="hyp3"><title>Hypothesis 3 .</title><p>Organizational learning is correlated with organizational justice.</p><p>Rationale: Organizations that prioritize learning and employee development tend to foster a fair and transparent environment. This atmosphere makes employees feel valued and motivates them to engage in learning processes.

Setting and Participants</title><p>Data collection for this study was conducted through convenience sampling from December 2023 to March 2024. We selected clinical nurses from five educational-therapeutic hospitals associated with Ardabil University of Medical Sciences in Iran. The choice of these specific hospitals was based on their diverse patient populations and varying clinical settings, which allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the nursing practices across different environments. To be eligible for participation, nurses had to meet specific criteria: they needed at least 6&#x02009;months of work experience, a willingness to participate, and no history of psychological or emotional disorders, such as depression or anxiety disorder. This criterion was established to ensure that participants could provide reliable responses without the influence of psychological distress.</p><p>Nurses who withdrew from the study or did not complete the questionnaire were excluded from the analysis. The sample size was determined based on the guidelines provided by Wolf et al. [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], which recommends a ratio of 5&#x02013;10 samples per variable (number of items) for structural equation modeling (SEM). Given that our study included 80 items, a sample size between 400 and 800 was deemed desirable, accounting for a 10% nonresponse rate. However, this study's sample attrition rate was 27.5%, resulting in data from only 319 participants being analyzed. Given the initial target range, this sample size provided a robust basis for the findings.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>3.3. Data Collection</title><p>The researchers collected data from a demographic information form, the organizational learning instrument-development stages (OLI-DS) instrument, the organizational justice questionnaire, and the organizational silence behavior scale. The questionnaires were designed using web-based software and sent to clinical nurses through email and virtual messengers (e.g., WhatsApp and Telegram). The participants then completed the questionnaires through a self-administered form.</p><sec id="sec3.3.1"><title>3.3.1. Demographic Information Form</title><p>This form was designed to collect demographic information based on relevant literature.

OLI-DS Instrument</title><p>Lyman and Ethington designed the OLI-DS instrument for clinical nurses [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The OLI-DS consists of 35 items and four subscales: identity and ownership (IO) (13 items), team and respect (TR) (6 items), accountability and support (AcS) (10 items), and reliability and sustainability (RS) (6 items). The items are rated on a four-point Likert scale (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;<italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 4&#x02009;=&#x02009;<italic>strongly agree</italic>). The instrument's score is determined by calculating the mean score for each subscale. Higher scores indicate more significant organizational learning.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3.3"><title>3.3.3. Organizational Justice Questionnaire</title><p>The organizational justice scale used in the study was developed by the authors in [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This scale includes 13 items with two subscales: PJ (7 items) and IJ (6 items). Participants rated their organizational justice using a five-point Likert scale from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>). The score range was from 13 to 65. The instrument's score is determined by calculating the mean score for each subscale. Higher scores indicate greater organizational justice. In this study, Cronbach's alpha of the total scale was reported to be 0.96, and its subscales were 0.77 and 0.91.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3.4"><title>3.3.4. Organizational Silence Behavior Scale</title><p>The organizational silence behavior scale used in the study was developed by Yal&#x000e7;&#x00131;n and Baykal [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This scale includes 32 items and has four subscales: silence climate (SC) (5 items), silence based on fear (SBF) (12 items), acquiesce silence (AS) (10 items), and silence based on protecting the organization (SBPO) (5 items). The scale was designed as a five-point Likert scale containing five response options, from 1 (<italic>never stay silent</italic>) to 5 (<italic>always stay silent</italic>). The instrument's score is determined by calculating the mean score for each subscale. As the total score on the scale increases, the level of silence also increases. The scale is self-reported to evaluate participants' behavior towardorganizational silence within their organizations. Cronbach's alpha for the scale was 0.93, and for the subscales, it was as follows: SC: <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.91, SBF: &#x02009;=&#x02009;0.91, AS: <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.93, and SBPO: <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.85.

Statistical Analysis</title><p>The study utilized IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 26.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA) to perform descriptive statistics, including frequency, percentage, mean, and standard deviation. These descriptive measures provided a foundational understanding of the participants' demographic characteristics and the distribution of key variables. Pearson correlation analysis was employed to explore the relationships between organizational learning, organizational justice, and organizational silence. This technique effectively quantifies the strength and direction of linear relationships between continuous variables, allowing us to identify potential associations that inform further analyses. A SEM was conducted using AMOS Graphics, version 24.0, incorporating the bootstrap method with 5000 replicates to test the hypothesized model. SEM was selected because it can simultaneously assess multiple relationships among variables and test complex theoretical models, providing a comprehensive view of the interactions between organizational learning, organizational justice, and organizational silence.</p><p>In addition, multiple linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between the dependent variable (organizational silence) and several independent variables, including demographic characteristics, organizational learning, and organizational justice. This technique was utilized to determine the extent to which these independent variables predict variations in the dependent variable. Three models were established as follows: Model 1 included demographic characteristics as independent variables to assess their impact on organizational silence. Model 2 focused on organizational learning as an independent variable. Model 3 examined organizational justice as another independent variable. The evaluation of the model's fit was based on established criteria to ensure the validity of the results. Specifically, we assessed the chi-square fit statistics divided by degrees of freedom (<italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup>/d<italic>f</italic>), aiming for a value less than 3, and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), with a threshold of less than 0.08 [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

As a result, the research findings led to the confirmation of the research hypotheses. It is worth mentioning that the power of the evaluated relationships was above 0.6, indicating a strong relationship between organizational justice, organizational learning, and organizational silence.

Discussion</title><p>Promoting open communication and active employee participation is essential to decrease organizational silence, which occurs when employees withhold their thoughts and concerns. Organizations can enhance their efficiency and productivity by creating an environment where employees feel valued and comfortable sharing their ideas. Our research focused on the relationship between organizational learning and silence in clinical nursing settings, specifically examining the influence of organizational justice. This study is the first to investigate the mediating role of organizational justice in the connections between organizational learning and nursing silence in a nursing context. This research contributes to the literature on reducing organizational silence.</p><p>Our research findings indicate that nurses demonstrated high levels of organizational learning, with average scores lower than those observed in Lyman's study [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. One study suggested that the nurses involved perceived an average level of overall organizational learning [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Moreover, Miri et al. reported that nurses' organization learning is at an average level and above the average score [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Contrary to the current study's findings, Goula et al.'s research indicated minimal organizational learning in healthcare facilities [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The researchers believe this situation may be due to ongoing monthly training provided by training groups consisting of supervisors and hospital training instructors. The supervisors were keen to impart knowledge to the nurses to improve their performance. At the same time, the training instructors were more enthusiastic than the nurses in hospital centers regarding guidance and training. In addition, nurse managers actively coach their nurses to ensure the accurate performance of their duties.</p><p>According to the results of this study, the average score of organizational silence among nurses was at high levels, which is generally higher than other studies on nurses' organizational silence [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Organizational silence refers to a phenomenon in which employees choose not to speak up or share their thoughts, ideas, or concerns due to a lack of psychological safety at work [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This result is to be expected because the lack of resources and high workload are signs that lead to organizational silence among nurses, which significantly contributes to increasing the organizational silence of employees [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The phenomenon of organizational silence within the context of Iranian nursing staff can be attributed to various factors, including the considerable pressures associated with their roles, the prevailing organizational culture, lack of resources, high workload, a lack of trust in management, and a shortage of safe spaces for open communication. Addressing this issue would involve the implementation of targeted educational programs aimed at fostering a culture of open dialog, as well as the creation of secure environments that encourage and facilitate discussions. These measures have the potential to significantly reduce organizational silence and consequently contribute to the enhancement of healthcare quality within this setting.</p><p>Our research findings showed that nurses rated organizational justice in medical education centers as average. Most research in the nursing workforce shows moderate organizational justice levels [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The observation can be attributed to various factors, including organizational culture, working conditions, and national culture. Creating a workplace culture that values and respects nurses' opinions and assessments and offers support to improve processes and working conditions can significantly increase nurse satisfaction and commitment. The implications of this can lead to a more comprehensive improvement in the quality of healthcare services overall.</p><p>This study explored the interconnection between organizational learning, organizational justice, and organizational silence. The study's results revealed a positive relationship between organizational learning and organizational justice, while a significant negative relationship exists between organizational learning and organizational silence. In addition, the study observed a significant negative correlation between organizational justice and silence. The research found that organizational learning has an indirect effect on organizational silence through organizational justice. This means that when an organization promotes learning, it also tends to foster a sense of fairness and equity, which in turn reduces the likelihood of employees remaining silent. It also has a direct impact on organizational silence. Although the mediating effect of organizational justice is only partial, it is still significant, indicating that it plays a crucial role in the relationship between organizational learning and silence. The researchers concluded that both the indirect path (organizational learning&#x02009;&#x027f6;&#x02009;organizational justice&#x02009;&#x027f6;&#x02009;organizational silence) and the direct path (organizational learning&#x02009;&#x027f6;&#x02009;organizational silence) are significant. However, since only part of the effect of organizational learning on organizational silence is accounted for by organizational justice, other factors may also contribute to the relationship.</p><sec id="sec5.1"><title>5.1. The Direct Effect of Organizational Learning on Organizational Silence</title><p>There was a significant negative relationship between organizational learning and silence among nurses, consistent with Atalla, Elamir, and Abou Zeid's study [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Organizational silence is when nurses withhold information or avoid speaking out to protect their colleagues or organizations [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It is essential to create and maintain a positive work environment. However, it is crucial to speak up when patient safety is compromised. [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. When an organization prioritizes continuous learning, it creates a culture of open communication that facilitates the transfer of knowledge and experiences [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This culture encourages people to speak up; share their opinions, ideas, and information; and avoid staying silent [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, when an organization welcomes different opinions and allows people to express themselves without fear of criticism or suggestions, it can help build trust and increase motivation to share information [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In general, organizational learning is critical in reducing organizational silence because it promotes sharing knowledge and experiences, thus improving the organization's ability to respond to new challenges and opportunities [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Encouraging continuous learning and open communication in the workplace is crucial for improving organizational performance and patient safety. Creating a work environment that welcomes diverse opinions and allows employees to express themselves without fear of criticism can help build trust and increase motivation to share information.</p><p>The findings confirmed that organizational justice was negatively associated with nurses' organizational silence, which aligns with previous studies [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Nurses are more likely to speak up about work-related issues when they feel their organization is fair and just [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In other words, promoting a work environment that values and prioritizes fairness and justice is critical in encouraging nurses to share important information, ideas, and feedback [<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The study also discovered that nurses who view their organization as just and fair are less likely to engage in organizational silence. Organizational silence is when employees hold back valuable information or avoid speaking up about work-related issues due to concerns about job security, fear of retaliation, or a belief that their perspective will not be taken [<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Developing a fair and just work environment is necessary to create a culture of openness, trust, and transparency among nurses. Fair compensation, recognition, career advancement, and a supportive, collaborative workplace culture can benefit nursing workforce engagement and empowerment. Encouraging nurses to share their perspectives can improve communication, problem-solving, and decision-making, ultimately enhancing patient care and outcomes.</p><p>Third, as this study hypothesized, organizational learning directly and positively impacted nurses' perceptions of organizational justice. This relationship has been observed for the first time. The study suggests that nurses who engage in continuous education and training are more likely to perceive greater fairness and justice in their workplace. This finding is important because it indicates that organizations prioritizing learning and development can foster a sense of justice among their employees. Organizational justice refers to how employees perceive the fairness of decisions and decision-making processes in the workplace and how they are treated by management [<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Employees who feel that their organization treats them fairly and justly are more likely to be motivated, productive, and committed to achieving individual and organizational goals.</p><p>Moreover, this perception of justice can help reduce behavioral anomalies and improve overall organizational performance [<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. By encouraging employees to participate in organizational learning, managers can create a positive work environment where employees feel valued and supported [<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. However, since this result was observed for the first time in Iran, further studies are required to confirm and expand on these findings. Additional research can validate the relationship between organizational learning and organizational justice among nurses and provide a more comprehensive understanding of this relationship. Organizations should develop strategies to promote continuous learning and development, fostering a sense of justice and fairness in the workplace.</p><p>The fourth finding of the study indicates that organizational justice plays a positive and meaningful role in mediating the relationship between organizational learning and organizational silence. Organizational learning helps organizations acquire new knowledge, reconstruct current knowledge, and identify areas that require change [<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. It enables the organization to adapt, perform targeted activities, and make informed decisions [<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Training and acquiring new knowledge make employees more productive and expressive and help avoid organizational silence, transforming the organization into a dynamic and efficient entity [<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Organizational justice is crucial in promoting collective work spirit, enhancing employee motivation, and increasing human resource diligence [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Fair distribution of the organization's achievements improves employee morale and encourages them to put more effort into their activities [<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Employees' perception of organizational justice is a fundamental factor that can influence their behavior and reduce organizational silence. However, further research is required to understand the relationship between these variables better and explain the results.</p></sec><sec id="sec5.2"><title>5.2. Limitations</title><p>Our research indicates that healthcare organizations can reduce silence by establishing an open communication culture and supporting a conducive work environment. The study affirms the significance of transparent communication in healthcare organizations and highlights the benefits of encouraging transparency and accountability. However, we acknowledge that our research has some limitations. The study relied on self-reported measures, which could introduce response bias and social desirability effects, possibly affecting the validity of the findings. In addition, the study's cross-sectional design limits our ability to establish causal relationships. Future research could benefit from longitudinal or experimental designs to explore the temporal dynamics of organizational learning, justice, and silence among nursing students. Comparative studies across cultural and organizational settings, complementing quantitative approaches with qualitative methods such as interviews or focus groups, could offer a more comprehensive understanding. Conducting intervention studies to evaluate the effectiveness of targeted educational programs, communication interventions, or organizational culture initiatives in promoting open communication among nursing students would be beneficial. Exploring the influence of additional variables such as leadership styles, organizational culture, and job satisfaction on organizational learning, justice, and silence could provide a more comprehensive understanding of nursing settings.</p></sec><sec id="sec5.3"><title>5.3. Implications to Nursing Management</title><p>Based on our results study, encouraging open communication and active employee participation is crucial for reducing organizational silence in healthcare organizations. Creating a work environment that values and prioritizes fairness and justice is critical in encouraging nurses to share important information, ideas, and feedback, ultimately improving patient care and outcomes. Promoting continuous learning and development can foster a sense of justice and fairness among nursing staff, leading to a positive work environment. Addressing factors such as high workload and a lack of resources is essential to reduce organizational silence among nurses and enhance healthcare quality. For better management practices, further research is needed to understand the complex interplay between organizational learning, justice, and silence in nursing settings.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>6. Conclusion</title><p>Our study shows a positive connection between organizational learning and organizational justice and a negative link between learning and silence. Organizational justice was also found to have a negative relationship with nurses' silence. Despite showing high levels of organizational learning, nurses' average scores were lower than previous studies. In contrast, their average silence scores were higher due to factors such as heavy workload and lack of resources. These findings have significant social and economic implications. Creating a culture of open communication within healthcare organizations can help empower nurses to express their opinions and concerns, ultimately improving healthcare quality. It is recommended that hospital management focus on training programs and creating supportive environments to strengthen organizational learning and justice. Future research should investigate the impact of specific interventions on organizational learning and justice and include diverse perspectives from various healthcare professionals. Your unique insights are crucial to gaining a deeper understanding of these dynamics and improving healthcare practices.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors wish to express their gratitude to the clinical nurses who participated in the study and the officials of the hospitals affiliated with the Ardabil University of Medical Sciences.
