This connection encompasses spiritual, cultural, and practical dimensions, guiding their stewardship practices and sustainable lifestyles through sophisticated knowledge systems emphasizing respect, reciprocity and harmony with nature. In contrast, it is only over the past 60&#x02009;years that Western science and medicine have directly recognized the close link between our health and the environment. Rachel Carson&#x02019;s 1962 book, <italic>Silent Spring</italic>, highlighted the impacts of environmental chemicals on songbirds, serving as a wake-up call. In 1987, the United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development published <italic>Our Common Future</italic>&#x02014;also known as the Brundtland Commission Report&#x02014;introducing the concept of Sustainable Development (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The following year, the World Meteorological Organization and United Nations established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to scientifically assess climate change impacts (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). These events underscore three core challenges we face today&#x02014;the triple planetary crisis of climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss&#x02014;each threatening the health of current and future generations (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>While Earth&#x02019;s climate naturally changes over time, human activities, particularly the unchecked extraction and burning of fossil fuels, have significantly increased the amount of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere, driving Earth&#x02019;s warming. Climate change and pollution are interlinked and their consequences include global temperature shifts; land surface changes; melting ice sheets and sea-level rise; increased intensity and frequency of bushfires/wildfires, heatwaves, storms, floods, and droughts; as well as famine, social disruptions, ecosystem loss and species extinctions (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). There are myriad of long term effects health effects and significant socioeconomic costs (<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), often disproportionately affecting Black, Indigenous, low-income, and multispecies communities at the frontlines of climate disasters and industrial pollution (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Pregnant women, infants and children are also highly susceptible, with resulting reproductive health impairments and adverse pregnancy outcomes (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Additionally, air pollution can harm cognitive function and increase dementia risk (<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>Biodiversity loss, driven by human activities including deforestation and agriculture, as well as natural disasters such as bushfires, reduces the variety of plant and animal species. This loss leads to crop failures and food insecurity (<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), depletes potential sources of medicinal compounds from plants and microorganisms (<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), and adversely impacts human physical and mental health (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Additionally, habitat destruction increases human-animal contact, heightening the risk of zoonotic diseases. This underscores the importance of natural habitat protection (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and ecological restoration as measures for disease prevention (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>To promote planetary health, efforts must address the impacts of climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss at community, policy, and systems levels (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). As a carbon emitter and polluter, the healthcare sector must also adopt environmentally sustainable practices, including transitioning to renewable energy sources, revising anesthetic and inhaler protocols and minimizing single-use products and plastics (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Additionally, the sector must pioneer innovative care models, adopt environmentally sustainable digital health solutions (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), promote reductions in transport-related emissions (<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and provide clinical governance improvements to assure sustainable care delivery. Consumer engagement and prevention investments are key for reducing healthcare demand and facilitating healthcare sector-driven systemic change to promote sustainable and equitable access to healthcare (<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>Building healthcare and public health workforce competencies begins with pre-registration education and is strengthened through lifelong learning and mentoring (<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Since the publication of the Planetary Health Education Framework (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) to address the planetary triple crisis (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), healthcare and public health educators have been working to integrate this framework into their overcrowded curricula. To meet the urgent calls from experts on bold action, wide-spread integration of planetary health education across health disciplines is essential. However, curriculum developers face barriers in mainstreaming planetary health education.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Reproduced from Faerron Guzm&#x000e1;n et al.

The health of future human civilization depends on thriving natural systems that help provide humans with clean air, clean water, and a buffer against disease outbreaks (<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>Since the report, the planetary health field has grown across the globe and universities are increasingly emphasizing the necessity of using a planetary health lens in education, regardless of the occupation students choose. For example, the London School of Hygiene &#x00026; Tropical Medicine offers a MSc in Climate Change and Planetary Health (<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), and the University of Edinburgh offers a MSc in Planetary Health (<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).

A key educational piece distributed has been the framework on Planetary Health Education (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec9"><label>2.2</label><title>Medical education</title><p>In 2015, leadership from 118 health professions schools worldwide, including the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health (UWSMPH), signed the Global Health Educators Climate Commitment, pledging to train the next generation of health professionals to effectively address the health impacts of climate change (<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Since then, there have been multiple calls to action by medical students, faculty, and medical organizations for curriculum on the impacts of climate-related health effects, planetary health and sustainable healthcare (<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25&#x02013;29</xref>). There are growing examples of how these curricula can and have been incorporated across the continuum of education for medical students to practicing providers (<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) and the development of a repository for such curriculum (<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Assessment of planetary health topics have been developed for licensing board examinations for practicing physicians within the United States (personal communication, Cecilia Sorensen 2024), and requirements of the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (the accrediting authority for US medical schools) to address common societal problems, further justify incorporating content on the triple planetary crisis (<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).</p><p>The UWSMPH MD curriculum now has planetary health-related content in five of the six required preclinical courses that span across the first 18-months of the medical school curriculum. Learning modalities include lectures, small group self-directed learning on asthma and an asynchronous video focused on climate change-related moral injury. There is also a panel discussion featuring Wisconsin tribal community members speaking on food sovereignty, health equity, and the importance of biodiversity and land stewardship. Additionally, students can take a two-week &#x0201c;Climate Change Medicine&#x0201d; elective.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>The curriculum development process consists of overlapping, iterative stages (mauve boxes).

To support effective addressing of these health inequities, the American Public Health Association and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#x02019;s Climate and Health Program provide technical assistance for local jurisdiction climate planning, identifying and engaging partners, and prioritizing community-driven interventions.</p><p>The Global Network for Academic Public Health emphasizes the role of public health schools and programs in planetary health. In the United States, the National <italic>Core Competencies for Public Health Profession</italic>a<italic>ls</italic> direct frontline public health staff to assess community health vulnerability and risks associated with climate change; to communicate environmental impact factors; to collaborate with communities to reduce health inequities by promoting environmental justice; to assess, develop, and implement organizational policies, programs, and services to advance environmental justice. The Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health (ASPPH) has established core competencies for Masters of Public Health (MPH) trainees across five domains (biostatistics, environmental health, epidemiology, health policy and management, and social and behavioral sciences) and seven cross-cutting domains (communications and informatics, diversity and culture, leadership, professionalism, program planning, public health biology, and systems thinking) (<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). These core competencies operate as guidelines for accredited schools of public health and a benchmark for non-accredited programs.</p><p>Historically, the environmental health domain of MPH training has focused on air and water contamination, drawing on study of well-studied pollutants such as lead, asbestos, and airborne particulate matter. Efforts are underway to enhance core competencies with climate change content through the Climate Change and Health for Public Health Education Toolkit, published in 2022 by the Association of Schools &#x00026; Programs of Public Health (ASPPH), a US-based organization representing public health schools and programs accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health in the United States and globally (<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Developed with the Global Consortium for Climate and Health Education (GCCHE) (<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) this program offers guidance for integrating climate and health content within existing core competency frameworks (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), spanning knowledge and analytical skills, collaboration and communication, policy, public health practice, and clinical practice domains (<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). It is of note that GCCHE has developed a suite of free, globally available online courses designed to educate interdisciplinary professionals on the health impacts of climate change and empower them to take action within their fields and communities (<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>).</p><p>At UW-Madison, MPH students typically satisfy their environmental health coursework requirement with a common overview course and engage with planetary health content through elective courses, including health-focused classes on air pollution, climate change, and planetary health (<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>).

The summit has been designed and refined over the past 10&#x02009;years to strengthen community-academic partnerships between the University and the 12 sovereign tribal nations in Wisconsin. The NNNHHS summit emphasizes the collaborative efforts necessary between Indigenous communities, tribal leaders, healthcare providers from both tribal and non-tribal entities, community members, and researchers to deliver effective health programs tailored to promote the health and wellbeing of Indigenous peoples and their communities. The summit also brings future healers, faculty, staff, and community members as a learning and healing community. Due to the continuation of colonial influences and systems, there are limitations in exposure and opportunities to learn about Indigenous ways of knowing and being. Therefore, the NNNHHS summits provide a safe place for students, faculty, healers, and community members to come together and learn from one another.

These common principles are summarized in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and encompass curriculum needs assessment, design and development, implementation and evaluation.</p><sec id="sec16"><label>3.1</label><title>Curriculum needs assessment</title><p>The call for curriculum change reflects society&#x02019;s demand for health professionals to deliver safe, quality healthcare. These demands are often reflected in accreditation requirements and associated competencies although sometimes these lag behind societal norms. To assess the need for such change and to bring the project into focus (<xref rid="ref71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>), a curriculum needs assessment can evaluate the current state and identify what to teach within the human health-environment connections. There are three components to consider: (1) What are the needs of target learners; (2) What is the goal of the curriculum; and (3) in which context will this curriculum be delivered? Required data can be gathered through surveys, interviews, focus groups, auditing the existing curriculum and engaging key partners (employers, students, experts, etc.,) to understand student needs, employer needs, accreditation standards and relevant competencies. These data are also essential for leadership buy-in as their support enables required resources to be made available for curriculum development, implementation and evaluation (<xref rid="ref72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). Regardless of discipline, some common principles apply to embedding planetary health education in the curriculum, such as top-down approaches driven by accreditation and regulatory requirements, and bottom-up approaches led by students and educators. Engaging various stakeholders, including Indigenous Peoples, community members, healthcare providers, policymakers, educators, and students, is essential in curriculum needs assessment.</p><p>To assess learner needs, the first question to ask is: Who are our learners? What would learners want to know or achieve in the context of planetary health education? This can be assessed by involving as many relevant key players as can be identified. Including healthcare providers, policymakers, educators, and students as key players also helps and can be achieved by developing a Curriculum Planning and Evaluation Committee. Assessing prior knowledge and current attitudes toward environmental issues and their personal connection to the natural world, can be leveraged to create a scaffolded curriculum. Such data can inform strategies for fostering environmental awareness and responsibility and establishes a baseline understanding of concepts like climate change and biodiversity, aiding in measuring curriculum impact. Considering student engagement in the digital age and potential impacts of generative artificial intelligence on assessment components are key strategies to ensure authentic learning (<xref rid="ref73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec17"><label>3.2</label><title>Curriculum planning and development</title><p>To contextualize the pedagogy, the process of developing clear and measurable <italic>learning objectives, activities, assessments and resources</italic> for the planetary health curriculum starts with reviewing and adapting the Planetary Health Education Framework for health science education (<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) to reflect local needs. The learning outcomes must encompass knowledge, skills, and dispositions necessary to understand and address planetary health challenges, in particular the triple crises of climate change, pollution and biodiversity loss. National professional accreditation standards exist to ensure the curriculum aligns with their expectations, and these can be further extended through UNESCO&#x02019;s Education for Sustainable Development competencies (<xref rid="ref74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). The curriculum philosophy, which will provide a set of common values and principles to guide all subsequent decision-making when developing, evaluating and refining the curriculum, can be developed in collaboration with the Curriculum Planning and Evaluation Committee (<xref rid="ref75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>).</p><p>To develop necessary knowledge, skills and graduate attributes, the pedagogical strategies and the curriculum must be tailored to geographical context and locally relevant climate challenges, prioritizing key topics and concepts resonating with the student&#x02019;s sense of belonging to the place. Structural reforms may be necessary in how diverse knowledges are produced and disseminated (<xref rid="ref76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>). To ensure a comprehensive exploration of human-environment interconnectedness, use realistic case studies to integrate climate change, water quality, biodiversity loss, food systems, and sustainability for culturally appropriate and locally relevant action decisions (<xref rid="ref77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). The Planetary Health Alliance provides a suite of case studies for this purpose (<xref rid="ref78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>). Balancing of content depth with breadth across various planetary health issues, while fostering hope and empowering students to act, is required.</p><p>The Planetary Health Alliance defines planetary health as a solutions-oriented, transdisciplinary field and social movement focused on analyzing and addressing the impacts of human disruptions to Earth&#x02019;s natural systems on human health and all life on Earth&#x02019; (<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). A transdisciplinary approach involves integrating knowledge and methods from various disciplines, including non-academic perspectives, to address complex real-world problems. This approach is crucial for implementing practical solutions in real-world settings because it brings together diverse stakeholders, including policymakers, practitioners, and community members, ensuring that solutions are holistic and applicable in practice (<xref rid="ref79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). While a transdisciplinary approach is essential for implementing practical solutions in real-world settings, the core of planetary health education lies in interdisciplinary connections. This refers to the collaboration and integration of insights from different academic disciplines to understand and address the complex challenges of planetary health. In education, the emphasis is on fostering interdisciplinary connections because they enable students to develop a comprehensive understanding of planetary health issues, considering their biological, environmental, social, and economic dimensions (<xref rid="ref80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>). This broad-based understanding is crucial for identifying and analyzing problems before they can be addressed through transdisciplinary action (<xref rid="ref81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>).</p><p>To reproduce this in the classroom, encourage diversity by bringing together students from different backgrounds such as social sciences, language arts, agronomy, environmental studies, engineering, or mathematics, alongside those in healthcare, public health, and veterinary medicine. Explore ways to infuse planetary health concepts into various subject areas for a holistic understanding. However, evidence suggests that health professions educators have limited capacity and confidence to teach planetary health (<xref rid="ref82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>), likely due to emerging nature of this field and their lack of formal training. Involving students as partners in curriculum development, using the principles of co-design, offers a practical approach to increase student engagement and educator capacity (<xref rid="ref83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>), as outlined in the case of melioidosis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Perhaps the most challenging aspect of any curriculum design is creating authentic assessments, particularly those that bring a group of diverse individuals together. Developing formative and summative assessments to gauge student learning and the effectiveness of the curriculum while reflecting genuine engagement with the planet is difficult. Usually, formative assessments involve quizzes, discussions, or self-reflection activities; our suggestion is to replace these activities by involving nature into the teaching and assessment tapestry. Using longitudinal case studies reflecting real-world environments as highlighted above, students can be grounded in experiential, scaffolded learning about the interconnectedness of nature and human health. For summative assessments which traditionally include projects, presentations, or essays, consider expanding these to meaningful engagements with real community needs, such as Indigenous Peoples health needs and Indigenous knowledges. Students can be taught to critically evaluate data to develop innovative solutions to environmental challenges (<xref rid="ref77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). While technology can enhance learning and engagement with planetary health topics, it can also alienate us from the natural world (<xref rid="ref84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>), so where technology is used, for example simulations, online databases, or interactive presentations, consider how can these support citizen science projects that focus on planetary health (<xref rid="ref85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>). Another consideration is managing and enhancing learners&#x02019; tolerance of uncertainty. The climate crisis is filled with uncertainty, and educators must nurture favorable responses to uncertainty in the way they develop and implement planetary health education. This can be achieved through strategic use of stimulus and moderators, as explained by Lazarus and Stephens in their handbook for educators, which includes discipline-specific examples of planetary health education (<xref rid="ref86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec18"><label>3.3</label><title>Curriculum implementation</title><p>To implement planetary health into the curriculum, decisions must be made regarding when and where in the program this integration should occur. If a single subject is shared across disciplines, each discipline should have the freedom to implement the subject in a manner that aligns with their professional needs. During pilot implementation and regardless of whether the mode of curriculum delivery is asynchronous or synchronous, virtual, hybrid or face-to-face, it is of value to build in evaluation processes that will run alongside the curriculum delivery. These evaluation processes can include learning platform analytics, built-in student feedback via surveys or open invitation to make constructive comments either anonymously or otherwise and setting up mechanisms for long-term follow ups on student career outcomes. It also requires teaching staff to reflect on the implementation process to decide on necessary adjustments to improve outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="sec19"><label>3.4</label><title>Curriculum evaluation</title><p>The process for curriculum evaluation should be established at the project&#x02019;s inception using education research-based frameworks such as Kirkpatrick-Barr Framework (<xref rid="ref87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>). This approach allows for detailed, prospective data collection during the curriculum&#x02019;s implementation, as well as longitudinal data on student outcomes and career choices, helping to refine curriculum content and delivery. The Curriculum Planning and Evaluation Committee can review these results and act as a source of further direction on curriculum development. Another opportunity for evaluation is curriculum benchmarking against set standards that can be developed in collaboration with other universities (<xref rid="ref88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>). Revised curriculum can then be implemented and reviewed on a regular basis.

The work presented here draws on educators&#x02019; experiences in overcoming barriers to equip future healthcare professionals with the knowledge and skills to reduce environmental health impacts and promote sustainable healthy lifestyles. Co-designing curriculum between students and educators shows great promise as an approach to increase both student engagement and educator capacity to facilitate planetary health education. To date, this often has been driven by planetary health champions, but top-down accreditation standards and bottom-up student demand for curriculum is accelerating. One limit to our work stems from the preponderance of literature reflecting experiences from the high-income counties. Yet, planetary health programs are growing globally, and new lessons will inevitably emerge from low-to-middle-income settings.</p><p>Incorporating an Indigenous lens enriches our proposed toolbox, as Indigenous knowledge systems provide critical insights into sustainable living and the interconnection of people and ecosystems. By learning from Indigenous perspectives, health professionals can develop culturally safe approaches that respect and incorporate Traditional Ecological Knowledges.

We offer a starting point for practical strategies and resources, ensuring systematic and iterative curriculum development, and allowing for continuous improvement and adaptation to changing needs for incorporating the planetary health into mainstream health education.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="sec21"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.</p></sec><sec sec-type="author-contributions" id="sec22"><title>Author contributions</title><p>ZL-T: Conceptualization, Methodology, Project administration, Visualization, Writing &#x02013; original draft, Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing.
